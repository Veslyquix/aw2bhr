/* MATCHED (wave 57, W57-C).
 *
 * Truncates the gUnknown_0849D5F8 move stack back to `a` entries and recomputes
 * the running fuel cost of every entry that survives. The loop body is ONE
 * statement and it is work/sub_08038848's body verbatim, with that function's
 * pushed (x, y) pair replaced by the stack's own unk2c[i] / unk20[i].
 *
 * The `?:` inside `costs` is a real branch, and that is why gUnknown_0849D5F8
 * is loaded TWICE in the body: CSE cannot carry the first load across it. The
 * `+ 1` on the gUnknown_08499598 subscript rides in the 0x59 / 0x5a
 * displacements (0x3c + 0x1d, 0x3c + 0x1e), the same one-based indexing
 * work/sub_08038848 and src/decomp/c_080211DC.c record for that array.
 *
 * TWO SPELLINGS ARE LOAD-BEARING, both isolated with compile_probe:
 *   - `(n = (s8)a)` INSIDE the comparison. Writing the obvious
 *     `unk45 = (s8)a - 1;` shortens through convert_to_integer into a QImode
 *     subtract on the RAW parameter, so agbcc has to copy r0 before the
 *     sign-extension overwrites it (`adds r4, r0, #0`, +2 bytes) and then
 *     emits a three-operand `subs r0, r4, #1`. The ROM subtracts from the
 *     EXTENDED value in place. Binding the extension to an int keeps the
 *     subtraction in SImode; binding it in its own statement instead puts the
 *     shifts ahead of the gUnknown_0849D5F8 load, so it has to happen inside
 *     the compare.
 *   - `p` and `idx` in the loop body, IN THAT ORDER, before `stack`. The ROM
 *     loads the struct pointer, sign-extends i, and only then does
 *     `adds rB, #0x38`; without `idx` the `+0x38` lands ahead of the shifts.
 *     `p` must NOT be reused for the unk2c/unk20 reads below the `?:` -- the
 *     ROM reloads gUnknown_0849D5F8 there, because the branch broke the CSE.
 *
 * The pool literals 0x1432 and 0x417A are member offsets on the
 * gUnknown_08499590 map, not addresses: too large for a THUMB 8-bit immediate,
 * so agbcc parks each in the pool and adds it to the map base. The local
 * struct + cast is what preserves the `(map + K) + idx` association; see the
 * gUnknown_08499590 comment in include/unknown-globals.h.
 *
 * trymatch reports `relocs: name different symbols that resolve to the same
 * address` at +0x148 (gUnknown_085D3E20 vs gUnknown_085D3DD0+0x50) -- the
 * documented false mismatch; 0x085D3E20 IS
 * &gUnknown_085D3DD0[0].unk38[0].unk18[0] (0x38 + 0x18 == 0x50). */
