/* MATCHED, wave 48 (W48-E). Byte-for-byte, relocs match.
 *
 * The two dead stores (`j = 0x06010080;` and `i = 0x060103c0;`) are NOT
 * decoration and must not be tidied away -- together they are the whole
 * difference between 94.0% and a match. Each gives the OTHER loop's counter a
 * reference inside this loop, which drops the dbra countdown below the
 * induction variables in allocno priority so it lands in r6 -- where the
 * original leaves it -- instead of stealing r4 or r5. The first was found by
 * decomp-permuter; the second is its mirror. See the "Cross-referencing the
 * OTHER loop's counter" chapter of docs/agbcc-codegen.md.
 *
 * Progression, so nobody re-walks it:
 *   one shared `int i;`         202 bytes (an extra `adds r5, r4, #0`)
 *   `int j, i;`, one per loop   200 bytes, 94.0%, register fields only
 *   + the two dead stores       MATCH
 *
 * The source loops are ASCENDING despite the ROM's `subs/cmp/bge`, confirmed
 * rather than assumed: each counter init sits LAST in its preheader. A clean
 * positive for W48-C's loop-direction test on an outermost loop.
 *
 * The two negative pool words (0xFFFFF980 = -0x680, 0xFFFFFD80 = -0x280) are
 * real subtractions from gUnknown_02010450 -- whatever object that symbol sits
 * in extends backwards from it, and the -0x280 run ends exactly at the symbol.
