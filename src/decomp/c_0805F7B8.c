/* Promoted from assembly; each function below is byte-for-byte

 * sub_0805F7B8 @ 0x0805F7B8

/* sub_0805F7B8 @ 0x0805F7B8, 348 bytes. MATCHED.
 *
 * The "no order given -- pick a target yourself" fallback of the battle-cursor
 * block: it scans every cell, scores it, and issues the best one as an ordinary
 * sub_0805D648 move command before longjmping out through sub_08071910. Twenty
 * functions tail-call it, which is why it reads as a bail-out everywhere else
 * in the block.
 *
 * gUnknown_0816DAB0 is NOT a global: the ROM word there holds 0x030040D8, so it
 * is agbcc's own -fforce-addr constant for gUnknown_030040D8. The honest
 * spelling reproduces it and the promotion must carry the rodata word --
 * data/promoted.json needs "rodata": ["0x0816DAB0"] for this function.
 *
 * Three spellings in the loop body are load-bearing and each was isolated with
 * compile_probe (wave 53, W53-E); all three are written up in
 * docs/agbcc-codegen.md.
 *
 *   - `cell` is BOUND and `*(s8 *)cell` is then read TWICE, once for the `< 0`
 *     test and once for `v`. The binding splits the address and the value into
 *     separate pseudos, and the second read is what CSE turns into the ROM's
 *     `adds r3,r0,#0` copy. A single `v = (s8)gUnknown_03003340[y][x];` gives
 *     one pseudo and loses the copy. (Binding is NOT what makes the load
 *     `ldrsb` -- the unbound spelling gets `ldrsb` here too. See the wave-53
 *     correction in the `ldrsb` chapter.)
 *
 *   - the score test is written INVERTED, as `unk00 == 0 || unk1a != 0x10`,
 *     because the ROM emits the LONG arm first and branches forward past the
 *     literal pool to the short one. agbcc lays the `then` arm out inline, so
 *     the natural way round puts the short arm first and the pool 0x34 bytes
 *     early -- with every instruction present and correct.
 *
 *   - `X * 10 - (n = v - 0x14)` rather than `X * 10 - (v - 0x14)`. fold's
 *     associate block rewrites `A - (B - K)` into `(A + K) - B`, and
 *     cross-jumping then merges the two arms' `subs r4,r0,r3` tails, costing 6
 *     bytes. The embedded assignment makes the right operand a MODIFY_EXPR that
 *     split_tree cannot take apart, and it keeps the evaluation order (minuend
 *     first) that a preceding `n = v - 0x14;` statement would invert. Both
 *     properties are needed and only this spelling gives both.
 *
 * sub_08071910 is the NORETURN THUMB->ARM veneer for LONGJMP, which is why
 * there is no epilogue.
