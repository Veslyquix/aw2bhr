/* Promoted from assembly; each function below is byte-for-byte

/* MATCHED. Not a sibling of the sub_08051DE0 cluster despite sharing its
 * callees and its globals (measured shape ratio 0.16). One tick of a unit's
 * movement: bump the slot's counter, and once it passes the record's
 * threshold, step two 8.8 fixed-point axes and re-place the sprite, then fire
 * sub_08050AEC when the moving side reaches its bound.
 *
 * Two things had to be settled before it would fall, both recorded on the
 * types rather than here:
 *
 *  - `gUnknown_03001470[proc].unk2c` is SIGNED. Its compare against the u16
 *    gUnknown_02029710[side].unk16 is `bgt`; as a `u32` member the u16 is
 *    promoted unsigned and agbcc emits `bhi`. Retyped in unknown-globals.h and
 *    the three promoted `= 0` writers re-verified.
 *
 *  - FOUR locals, in two pairs holding the same two values. `a = c = ...`
 *    does NOT work: the copy is coalesced away, one stack slot disappears and
 *    the frame comes out 8 bytes short. Four independent assignments keep four
 *    slots, and the ROM's store order (0x10, 8, 0x14, 0xc) is what fixes the
 *    order they are written in. The pair at 0x10/0x14 drives the body; the
 *    pair at 8/0xc is only ever handed to sub_08050AEC in the non-zero arm --
 *    which is also the proof they are distinct variables, because in the
 *    `c == 0` arm gcc const-folds c into `movs r0,#0` and still loads [sp,#8]
 *    in the other one.
 *
 * `if (gUnknown_0300454C[1] == 1) gUnknown_0300454C[1] = 1;` is not a
 * transcription error -- the ROM really does `ldrh; cmp #1; bne; strh` with
 * the loaded register, which is a self-assignment cse rewrote from the
 * literal. It is kept verbatim because anything else changes the bytes. */
