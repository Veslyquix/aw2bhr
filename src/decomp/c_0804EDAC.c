/* One frame of a 0x90-step vertical wobble: the slot's own unk28 is the phase,

 *
 * THE SUM IS AN `int` TEMPORARY, and that is what makes the table read `ldrsh`.
 * Written as `entries[b].y += gUnknown_085523E0[phase]` the whole addition
 * happens in HImode -- only the low halfword survives the `strh` -- so agbcc
 * drops the sign extension and emits `ldrh`, losing the one instruction that
 * proves the table is signed. Computing the sum in a word and storing it is
 * byte-exact and keeps the `movs r3, #0; ldrsh` register-offset form. */
