/* Draws one run through sub_0801B9C8 and advances the two cursors it consumed
 * by however much the callee reported.
 *
 * The struct is a pointer parameter only, so it lives here rather than in
 * include/unknown-globals.h. unk32 is reached as `adds r2, #0x32; ldrb [r2]`
 * rather than a displaced load because Thumb's `ldrb` displacement stops at 31.
 *
 * THE HALFWORD SUM MUST BE ITS OWN STATEMENT. Folded into the argument list the
 * callee's second argument is evaluated first, gUnknown-style: `unk20` loads
 * into r1 before the two `ldrh`s, which then need r5 and a wider push. Bound to
 * a local, the sum is computed while r1 is still free and the ROM's register
 * assignment falls out. The operand order inside it is also fixed -- agbcc
 * loads the SECOND operand first, so `unk2c + unk2e` is what emits
 * `ldrh [#0x2e]` ahead of `ldrh [#0x2c]`. */
