/* sub_080637AC finds the gUnknown_03001470 slot running gUnknown_0848A42C and

 * range, hence `adds r0,#0x48`). The field was narrowed out of

 * The branch polarity is load-bearing and was measured: `if (x <= 0xf)
 * return 1; return 0x10;` compiles to `bls` to the return-1 block with the
 * 0x10 falling through, i.e. the mirror image of the ROM. Testing the OTHER
 * way round -- `> 0xf` first -- puts `movs r0,#1` in the fall-through and the
 * pool between the two arms, exactly as the ROM has it. Two spellings of one
 * comparison, and only one of them is this function. */
