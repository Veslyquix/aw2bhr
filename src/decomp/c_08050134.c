/* MATCHED, and the FIRST of a byte-identical pair -- sub_08050364 is the same
 * function again, same instruction stream and same pool words, found by
 * tools/overlap_screen.py rather than by reading the block. Both are
 * zero-fan-in callbacks.
 *
 * It re-syncs one OBJ's tile number against the slot's stashed attributes: read
 * the current attributes with sub_0801566C, take the 10-bit delta between the
 * caller's attr2 and them, write the fetched tileNum back into the caller's
 * attr2, and if that delta is new for this proc AND the proc still owns the
 * gUnknown_02029A10 entry, publish it.
 *
 * The second parameter is `u16 *` and NOT `struct OamData *`, which is the one
 * derivation that cost anything. The ROM subtracts the RAW halfword at +4
 * (`ldrh r3,[r1,#4]; subs r0,r3,r0`) with no bitfield extraction on that side,
 * and rebuilds it with an explicit `movs #0xfc; lsls #8; ands; adds`. Through
 * `struct OamData *` the `p->tileNum` read emits its own `lsls #22; lsrs #22`
 * pair that force_to_mode does not remove, and the store mask comes out as a
 * 32-bit `ldr =-0x400` from the pool instead of the ROM's 16-bit 0xFC00. The
 * local `oam` IS a struct OamData -- only the caller's buffer is the raw
 * halfword view.
 *
 * `oam.tileNum` is read TWICE rather than bound: the ROM keeps `attr2 << 22` in
 * one register and re-extracts it with a second `lsrs #22` at the store, which
 * a `t = oam.tileNum;` local collapses into one. And the store is
 * `(p[2] & 0xFC00) + oam.tileNum`, in that order -- the mask term first, which
 * is what puts `ands` ahead of the second `lsrs`. */

/* Sibling of the matched sub_0804FCA4 (src/decomp/c_0804FCA4.c), which supplies
 * the whole head verbatim -- the gUnknown_03001470 slot reads, the
 * sub_080156C4 state, the gUnknown_085D6C88 sound lookup and the
 * `e * sizeof(entry) + c * sizeof(group) + (u8 *)base` pointer idiom. What is
 * new is a six-step per-slot counter (gUnknown_02029B94, stepped by
 * gUnknown_02029B80 and wrapped at 6) that indexes a per-phase (x, y) offset
 * pair out of gUnknown_085523B0.
 *
 * ONE spelling is load-bearing and it is a wave-20 rule
 * (docs/agbcc-codegen.md): `gUnknown_085644D4[(row = gUnknown_02028E5C[c])[1]]`.
 * Written as the plain `gUnknown_02028E5C[c][1]`, fold associates the +2 onto
 * the symbol -- `(base + 2) + c * 4` -- and pays an `adds` that the ROM puts in
 * the `ldrh` displacement. Binding the row fixes that, but only if the binding
 * happens inside the expression: as its own statement it is emitted twelve
 * instructions early, ahead of the two gUnknown_085523B0 addresses the ROM
 * computes first. `row` is never read again.
 *
 * `dx` and `dy` are u16 locals rather than inline expressions because the ROM
 * truncates the y difference to 16 bits BEFORE adding it to the field (`lsls
 * #16` early, `lsrs #16` at the use, split around the entry-pointer
 * computation), which no inline spelling reproduces -- with the whole
 * expression in the assignment, combine folds the truncation into the `strh`. */
