/* sub_0805653C @ 0x0805653C
 *
 * Fills gUnknown_0202980A[side][0..] with the slots that are "live" -- entry
 * .unk01 == 0 and .unk00 != 0 -- walking them in the gUnknown_0855218C
 * permutation order, and returns how many it wrote.
 *
 * The return type is u16 and that is read off the CALLER (sub_0805634C): it
 * stores the result back into its own u16 third parameter and passes it on to
 * sub_080564B8 with no narrowing at either point, which a u32 return cannot
 * do. The value returned is this function's own first parameter, which both
 * arms reuse as the running result -- 0/1 in the first, the requested count in
 * the second.
 *
 * `i == 5` sets n = a rather than breaking: that is what the ROM's
 * `cmp r7,#5; bne; adds r6,r5,#0` in front of the bottom test says, and it is
 * why the loop is a `while (n != a)` and not a counted one.
