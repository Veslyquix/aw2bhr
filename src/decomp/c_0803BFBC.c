/* WAVE 87 (W87-E): **MATCHED**, 536/536 (`configured`). Parked waves 50, 62,
 * 66, 73, 80, 82, 83 -- the last five of them on "ONLY the two trailing-loop
 * PREHEADERS", i.e. the wave-50 tension: `k` in the for-init gives the right
 * loop BODY but a source-first preheader; `k` written inline gives the right
 * preheader ORDER but fold folds the +1 into the biv.
 *
 * THE TENSION IS FALSE. It only exists while SOME of the preheader values are
 * source statements and the rest are LICM hoists -- then the source ones are
 * emitted first as a block and the hoists after, and no ordering of the two
 * groups is the ROM's interleave. Make EVERY value in the preheader a source
 * statement, in the ROM's order, inside a hand-inverted loop (zero-trip `if`
 * plus `do/while`), and nothing is left for LICM to order:
 *
 *     i = 0;                                    <- movs r3,#0
 *     if (i <= 3)
 *     {
 *         dst = d->unk0d;                       <- mov  r4,sb   (cse: a copy)
 *         t   = gUnknown_03003FC0.unk02 - 0xb4; <- ldrb r1,[r1,#2] / subs #0xb4
 *         tbl = gUnknown_020280D4;              <- ldr  r6,=gUnknown_020280D4
 *         k   = t * 28 + 1;                     <- lsls/subs/lsls/adds r2,r0,#1
 *         do { ...; i++; } while (i <= 3);
 *     }
 *
 * The table's force-addr `ldr` sits BETWEEN the subtract half and the multiply
 * half of what wave 82 read as "ONE expression": it is not one expression in
 * the original, it is two statements with the table bind written between them.
 * Wave 82's "no statement boundary produces this" is refuted -- the boundary
 * that produces it is the one INSIDE the arithmetic, not around it.
 *
 * SECOND FACT, worth as much as the first: A POINTER-VARIABLE SUBSCRIPT AND AN
 * ARRAY SUBSCRIPT PUT THE TWO REGISTERS OF THE ADD IN OPPOSITE ORDER.
 * `tbl[i + k]` with `u8 *tbl` emits `adds r0,r6,r0` (pointer first); the ROM
 * and the old array spelling `gUnknown_020280D4[i + k]` emit `adds r0,r0,r6`
 * (index first). Binding the table to a pointer local to place its pool load
 * therefore costs the body's operand order -- 4 bytes, one insn in each of the
 * two loops. Casting the bind back to an integer sum restores it:
 *     dst[i] = *(u8 *)((i + k) + (int)tbl);
 * which keeps the index as the first operand while the bind still owns the
 * `ldr`. 94.8%% -> 98.7%% (staged preheaders) -> MATCH (index-first sum).
 *
 * PROMOTION NOTE: this match needs its .rodata pool word placed --
 *     "rodata": ["0x08091130"]   in this function's data/promoted.json entry,
 * then tools/split_rodata.py and tools/gen_lds.py before building. The four
 * reported reloc differences are all the same-address artefacts already
 * recorded in the park (gUnknown_03004002 = gUnknown_03003FC0+0x42,
 * gUnknown_03003FFD = +0x3d, gUnknown_085C77E0 = gUnknown_085C77DC+4).
 *
 * Everything settled in waves 73/80 is unchanged and still load-bearing: the
 * two if/else stores for `d->unk02` (cross-jumped into the ROM's arm order),
 * the int-typed switch subject with `case 0: default:` written first, and the
 * `do { d->unk08 = sub_080248F8(); d->unk15 = 0; } while (0);` wrapper that
 * puts d in r5 and &d->unk11 in r6. Do not tidy the wrapper away. */
