/* The +2 must ride on the BASE, not the index. `gUnknown_0849A2A6[a4 * 3 + 1]`
 * folds the element into the index (`adds r0, #1` before the scale) and
 * `gUnknown_0849A2A6 + 1` folds it into the relocation
 * (`.word gUnknown_0849A2A6+0x2`); only wrapping the table in a struct and
 * reaching the array THROUGH a member gives the ROM's `adds r1, #2` on the
 * loaded base. This is the third `.rodata` spelling docs/agbcc-codegen.md
 * describes for a hoisted member offset, used here on ordinary ROM data.
 *
 * A struct of three s16 does NOT work as the element type: ARM's
 * STRUCTURE_SIZE_BOUNDARY is 32, so a 6-byte struct rounds up to 8 and the
 * index scales by `lsls #3` instead of the ROM's `* 6`. */
