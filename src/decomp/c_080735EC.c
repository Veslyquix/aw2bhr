/* Points the HBlank DMA slot at gUnknown_0202F8DC, fills all 0xA0 scanlines
 * of that table with 0x10, and then sets up the blend: effect 3, both
 * coefficient shadows and BLDY cleared, target1 = bg0 alone, target1_enable_bd
 * cleared.
 *
 * The table pointer is re-loaded from the global on EVERY pass rather than
 * hoisted, because the halfword store through it may alias the pointer
 * variable itself and agbcc's alias analysis does not rule that out. Only the
 * global's ADDRESS is hoisted (r4).
 *
 * The blend tail is the same shape as src/decomp/c_0806717C.c: `.bits.effect`
 * is a QImode read-modify-write (here an all-ones value, so the AND drops out
 * and only `orr #0xc0` remains), the five target1 layer bits are ONE HImode
 * read-modify-write on `.raw` (a 5-bit field at bit 0 would have been QImode),
 * and target1_enable_bd really is a single bit -- the `movs #0x21; rsbs` mask
 * is the bitfield tell, where a scalar `&= ~0x20` would emit a bare
 * `movs #0xdf`. */
