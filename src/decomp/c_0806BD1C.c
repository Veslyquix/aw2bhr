/* Renders a NUL-terminated byte string into two rows of a tilemap and returns
 * its pixel width (8 per glyph). Four punctuation codes map to fixed tiles
 * 0x7a..0x7d; anything else is the raw byte biased by 0x1f. The second row is
 * always the first row's tile + 0x20, i.e. the glyph's bottom half.
 *
 * `dst` is a plain `u16 *` and the second store is `dst[0x20]`, not a struct
 * member at +0x40 -- src/decomp/c_0806BD6C.c measured that discriminator on the
 * sibling function: through a member agbcc emits the VALUE's add before the
 * ADDRESS's, while `dst[0x20]` emits them in the ROM's order (`adds r1, #0x40`
 * then `adds r0, #0x20`). 0x20 * 2 == 0x40 is past `strh`'s 5-bit
 * displacement, which is why the add appears at all. */
