/* Rebuilds the gUnknown_0200C020 record and starts script gUnknown_08489548.
 * Byte-identical twin of sub_080146D4, which names gUnknown_08489568 instead
 * -- the only difference between the two, and the only reason they are two
 * functions.
 *
 * The address of gUnknown_0200C020 is bound to a LOCAL before the
 * gUnknown_03002514 store, not written out at each of its two uses: the ROM
 * materialises that pool word first and reloads r0 from r8 at both calls,
 * where naming the global twice materialises gUnknown_03002514's word first
 * and lets r0 survive, two instructions short.
 *
 * Arguments 4..6 are u16 (narrowed in the prologue, ahead of the store);
 * 1 and 2 are int and are cast to sub_080147B4's s16 parameters at the call.
 * It returns sub_080152EC's proc pointer -- `pop {r1}; bx r1`.
