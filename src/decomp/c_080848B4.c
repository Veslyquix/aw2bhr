 * "scan a range, return FALSE the moment one record's 12-bit field at bit 8 is
 * zero". The counter runs over a GLOBAL id range (0x8a..0xab) while the record
 * pointer starts at gUnknown_0200C2D0[0], so the subscript carries the bias --
 * `i - 0x8a` -- and strength reduction turns it into the `adds r1, #8` giv with
 * the pool word at addend 0. The loop is NOT reversed by check_dbra_loop
 * despite `i` surviving only in the exit test, because the early `return FALSE`
 * gives it two exits; sub_08084804 in the same block has one exit and IS
