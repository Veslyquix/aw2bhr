/* MATCHED. sub_08052358 plus a tail that fires once, on the last frame
 * (`unk28 == 8`): hand the slot's sprite id to sub_080157A4 / sub_080157F4.
 * Read sub_08052358's comment first; everything above the tail is identical.
 *
 * `e` is LOAD-BEARING and it is the whole cost of this function. Written inline
 * as `sub_080157A4(gUnknown_02029808[a].unk24[b], gUnknown_08553B10[a])` agbcc
 * expands argument 1's address, loads it, then does the same for argument 2;
 * the ROM expands gUnknown_08553B10's address FIRST and issues the two loads in
 * the opposite order. Binding the second argument to a local moves the address
 * expansion to the binding statement, and `combine` then folds the load itself
 * back down to the call site -- so the `ldrsh` immediately before the `bl` is
 * NOT evidence against a local. `u16 e`, `s16 e` and a `u16 *` bound to
 * `&gUnknown_08553B10[a]` are byte-identical; only the inline form differs.
 * See the wave-20 section in docs/agbcc-codegen.md. The r4/r6 swap in the head
 * that goes with it is a consequence of this one edit, not a second fact. */

/* MATCHED, first draft, one attempt. The slide-in animation tick that goes with
 * the matched sub_08052154: bump the slot's frame counter, then re-place the
 * sprite at an x offset proportional to it, mirrored for side 0.
 *
 * It is `sub_08052270` minus that function's tail, and both are reached only as
 * slot 2 of an animation descriptor (gUnknown_085536D4 and gUnknown_085536BC),
 * which is why neither has a `bl` caller anywhere in asm/.
 *
 *  - `dx` is `(u16)(unk28 * 4)`. Read the `lsls #0x12; lsrs #0x10` pair as
 *    `(u32)x << 18 >> 16`, i.e. a net left shift of two truncated to 16 bits --
 *    NOT a mask plus a shift. The negation arm is the same u16 arithmetic
 *    (`rsbs; lsls #0x10; lsrs #0x10`).
 *  - The entry term is written FIRST in the x sum, for the reason
 *    src/decomp/c_08052154.c gives: agbcc expands the addresses in source order
 *    and issues the loads in the opposite one, so naming gUnknown_02029A10
 *    first is what puts its pool word ahead of gUnknown_08552D80's.
 *  - `gUnknown_08552D80[3]` is the constant row c_08052154.c identifies, folded
 *    to `adds rB, #0x56` (3 * 0x1c + offsetof unk02) on the base.
 *  - gUnknown_03001FBC is re-read after the `unk28++` because the word store
 *    can alias it; that costs nothing and needs no local. */
