/* MATCHED (wave 87, W87-C). 240/240 bytes.
 *
 * The park (waves 38/58/59) classified this as a HOLD/REMATERIALISE INVERSION
 * with no source lever, on two claims that are both REFUTED here:
 *
 *  1. W59-B: "the inner bound appears TWICE from ONE source expression and
 *     agbcc gives the two copies different register strategies -- no spelling
 *     of one source expression can request two strategies." True of ONE
 *     expression; the answer is to write TWO. Hand-inverting both loops
 *     (zero-trip `if` + `do/while`) makes the guard and the bottom SEPARATE
 *     source expressions, so the inner guard can read the held map pointer
 *     one-level (`*(u16 *)map`) while the inner bottom re-walks the chain
 *     two-level (`*(u16 *)*ga`). Same lever as the promoted sub_0803E6C4-family
 *     drafts, which read one halfword through two different symbols.
 *
 *  2. W59-B: "the ROM's `mov r8,r0` sits AFTER the zero-trip compare because it
 *     is an LICM hoist; a source binding is a statement and always lands BEFORE
 *     the compare, so there is no source position inside a preheader." Also
 *     false once the loop is hand-inverted: the first statement INSIDE the
 *     zero-trip `if` IS the preheader. `map = gUnknown_08499590;` written there
 *     costs no load at all -- cse folds it into the guard's own `ldr r0,[r1]`
 *     -- and leaves exactly the ROM's bare `mov`.
 *
 * The last two bytes were the ORDER of the two preheader copies. With only
 * `map` bound, agbcc emits `mov r8,r0` (the source bind) before `mov sl,r1`
 * (the address, a real LICM hoist attributed to the loop's first line). Binding
 * the ADDRESS to its own local as well -- `ga = &gUnknown_08499590;` FIRST --
 * makes both copies source binds, and they are then emitted in SOURCE ORDER.
 * `ga` costs nothing: cse folds it into the guard's force-addr `ldr r1,=sym`.
 * See the wave-87 chapter in docs/agbcc-codegen.md.
 *
 * Everything the park called settled stayed settled: proc->unk4c = ...; buf =
 * proc->unk4c; in that order, the s16 x/y with y's shifted form in the single
 * stack word, the (s8)-on-u8 cell test, and all four particle stores.
