 *
 * The four BG-priority stores are `priority = 0/1/2/3` in gUnknown_0300251C,
 * 030030B4, 03001FE8, 03002B6C order -- the mask constant -4 is materialised
 * once as `movs #0x11; rsbs; adds #0xd` off the DISPCNT mask above it and then
 * reused, which is the CSEd-constant chain and not four different values.
 *
 * `forced_blank = 0` is a bitfield store even though it compiles to a bare
 * `movs r0, #0x7f; ands` with no `neg`: the field is the top bit of the byte,
 * so its complement mask already fits an 8-bit immediate. */
