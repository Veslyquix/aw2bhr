/* The index local has to be NARROW, and that is the whole difficulty here.
 * agbcc has two expansions for a comparison used as a value: the branching
 * `cmp r0,#0; beq .L; movs r0,#1` and the branchless `(x | -x) >> 31`
 * (`rsbs; orrs; lsrs #0x1f`) the ROM uses. They are the same six bytes, so the
 * size never gives it away. Which one appears is decided by the type of the
 * destination, not by the comparison: with `int i` or `u32 i` -- and equally
 * with the comparison written inline as the subscript, or as `?:`, or as `!!`,
 * or with the call hoisted into its own statement first -- every spelling
 * probes as the branching form. Assigning to a `u8` (or `u16`) local is what
 * produces the ROM's branchless form, because the narrowing makes gcc want the
 * value in a register rather than a jump. The same "narrow the destination and
 * the expansion changes" effect is what settles sub_08019DEC's final shift.
 *
 * The separate statement is load-bearing for a second reason: written inline as
 * a subscript, the `gUnknown_03003FC0.unk02` load and its `muls #0x5c` get
 * hoisted ABOVE the `bl` and the index degenerates into a conditional
 * `adds r4, #4`. The ROM evaluates the call first, so the index is its own
 * statement. */
