 * gUnknown_08580934->unk70[] mark back to 0, the +0x31 sub-mode flag cleared,
 * and the +0x2d counter bumped -- the same `unk2d++` opener five other 0x0806D
 * handlers use.
 *
 * The ROM reaches gUnknown_08580934 through a ROM word at 0x0816E14C rather
 * than naming it, i.e. `ldr =0x0816E14C; ldr; ldr` where sub_080665D4 next door
 * has a plain `ldr =gUnknown_08580934; ldr`. That is agbcc's own -fforce-addr
 * address-constant pool, not a global: this function reads the symbol four
 * times, which is the threshold at which the address gets parked instead of
 * rematerialised. Written the honest way -- name the global -- and the build
 * places the .rodata word itself. No gUnknown_0816E14C declaration is needed or
 * wanted. */

/* Scans the live slots for one the player has just acted on: on A (0x1) over a

 * +0x28/+0x2a position offset by (8, 0x10); on B (0x2) over a mark of 1 it
 * tears the slot's node down. Either way it plays a sound and RETURNS -- the
 * loop only continues while nothing has happened. sub_0806666C is the same
 * sweep over unk44[] instead of unk34[].
 *
 * unk70[] is declared `u8` in include/unknown-globals.h but is read here with
 * `ldrb; lsls #24; asrs #24`, i.e. SIGNED, and the writers agree it is: 0xFF
 * (src/decomp/c_08066580.c), 1 (c_08066374.c) and 0 (sub_08066710) are 0, 1 and
 * -1 as s8. The cast is at the use rather than on the member: two other
 * promoted files read the same member zero-extended and retyping it would
 * change their bytes. Recorded in the header, not acted on.
 *
 * The key-state base is bound INSIDE the loop body, which is what puts its pool
 * `ldr` in the preheader after the guard where the ROM has it. A function-scope
 * binding is a source statement and lands BEFORE the `i = 0` init, which also
 * swaps the two pool words; the cast-subscript spelling with no binding at all
 * emits the pool word TWICE (once per if-arm) and an `add` per use, because
 * with only two references in two basic blocks CSE will not hold the address.
 * Block scope makes it an LICM hoist instead, and LICM hoists land exactly
 * there. Same lever as src/decomp/c_08064410.c's, read the other way round. */

 * unk11[] being the per-slot byte table that unk44[] itself is indexed by, so

 * The two position reads are bound to locals before the call. Written inline as
