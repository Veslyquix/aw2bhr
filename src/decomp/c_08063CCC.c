/* The rotating-sprite idiom of its matched neighbour sub_08063BE0
 * (src/decomp/c_08063BE0.c): four Div calls feeding SetObjAffine, every
 * divisor guarded by the same `!= 0 ? : 2` ternary, then one sub_0801BD00.
 *
 * The two `lsls #0x14 / lsrs #0x10` and `lsls #0x12 / lsrs #0x10` pairs on the
 * merged path are not a mask plus a shift: read as `(u32)x << a >> b` they are
 * `(u16)(a5 * 0x10)` and `(u16)(a5 * 4)`. The truncation belongs to the u16
 * LOCAL, not to sub_0801BD00's parameter -- the middle arm calls sub_0801BD00
 * directly with `a5 * 4` and emits a bare `lsls r3, r7, #2` with no truncation,
 * which it could not do if the fourth parameter were narrow.
 *
 * The three computed values are assigned BACK INTO THE PARAMETERS rather than
 * into fresh locals, and that is the whole difference between 64.0% and a
 * match: with fresh locals the frame is the right size and the instruction
 * stream is otherwise identical, but x, y and the divisor lose r8/r9/sl to the
 * 0x200 constant and to `w`, which costs one extra `mov r8, r1` (absorbed by
 * the alignment slot ahead of the first pool word, so the SIZE stays exact).
 * Reusing the parameters gives x, y and v the entry pseudos, which are the
 * earliest allocnos in the function, and t/w/the first Div result spill
 * instead -- exactly the ROM's assignment.
