/* The `if`/`else` spelling is load-bearing. `int n = 0x11; if (x < 0) n = 0;`
 * lets agbcc's scheduler hoist the `movs r2, #0x11` ahead of the field load,
 * and a ternary either way inverts which arm is preset -- only the two-armed
 * `if`/`else` puts the constant between the sign-extend and the `cmp`, where
 * the ROM has it.
 *
 * `gUnknown_08499578 + (n + 0x200)` with the constant bound to the INDEX, not
 * to the pointer: `p + n + 0x200` parses as `(p + n) + 0x200` and adds 0x400 to
 * the pointer after the scaling, where the ROM folds it into the offset
 * (`lsls #1` then `+ 0x400`) before the pointer is even loaded. */
