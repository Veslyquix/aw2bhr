 * and not an argument.
 *
 * sub_08019260 was promoted returning `int`, which cannot produce the ROM's
 * `lsls r0, r0, #0x18`; it is `bool8`, and the evidence is the whole ROM rather
 * than this call -- all twenty `bl sub_08019260` sites narrow to eight bits and
 * two of them keep the value with a trailing `lsrs #0x18`. A `bool8` local here
 * would reach the same bytes without touching the callee, so this one site
 * proves nothing on its own. Retyped in c_08019260.c and re-verified there. */
