/* MATCHED, wave 46 (W46-A), fourth attempt.
 *
 * Counts, for every character of the string at a2, how many map cells carry a
 * terrain id equal to it: zero the counters, then walk the gUnknown_03003F68
 * render buffer (u8 width at +0, u8 height at +1, u16 tiles from +2) mapping
 * each tile through gUnknown_0849959C and masking to 5 bits.
 *
 * TWO READOUTS, EACH WORTH AN ATTEMPT.
 *
 * 1. `int i = 0;` must be a DECLARATION INITIALISER, not the `for` init. The
 *    ROM sets the counter to zero BEFORE `bl sub_0802163C`, which puts its live
 *    range across the call and earns it a callee-saved register; written as
 *    `for (i = 0; ...)` the store lands after the call and the counter takes a
 *    scratch. 88.0% -> 98.9%.
 *
 * 2. THE BUFFER POINTER NEEDS ITS OWN TWO STATEMENTS (wave-43 W43-I rule, and
 *    its second half). Spelled inline the address `adds` puts the sum in the
 *    INDEX's register; the ROM puts it in the base's. That was the entire
 *    2-byte residual of a 98.9% candidate, and no operand reordering inside the
 *    expression moved it. The `+ 1` stays in the load displacement either way,
 *    so this is the binding and not the struct-vs-pointer question.
 *
 * The buffer must stay a cast rather than a struct for the same reason
 * src/decomp/c_080377C4.c records: the ROM leaves the +2 in the `ldrh`
 * displacement, which a COMPONENT_REF would spend an instruction on. The global
 * is re-read at both loop bounds rather than bound to a local -- ordinary
 * output for a `void *` global that a store might alias. */
