/* gUnknown_08136148 is an agbcc .rodata address constant holding 0x03004538
 * (checked against baserom.gba), not an object in ROM, so the three reads name
 * gUnknown_03004538 directly and agbcc re-emits the pool word.
 *
 * The two wrap steps are plain if/else with a store in BOTH arms, even though
 * the ROM has only one `strh`: cross-jumping merges the pair. Neither shorter
 * spelling works. A `?:` gives one store but agbcc canonicalises
 * `x == 0 ? 8 : x - 1` into `x != 0 ? x - 1 : 8` and emits the decrement as the
 * fall-through, which is the opposite block order from the ROM; hoisting the
 * value into a `u16` local instead forces a `lsls #16; lsrs #16` truncation on
 * the increment and pushes gUnknown_03004524's address into the .rodata pool
 * (+16 bytes). */
