/* Loads the per-variant tile blob for the overlay and arms the blend registers.
 * The variant index at +0x58 selects an 8-byte record: its first word is the
 * blob for Decompress, its second is copied to +0x60, which c_0807662C.c and
 * sub_080765D8 both read as the x-offset of the second sprite. The ROM reaches
 * the second word by bumping the record base (`adds r4, #4`) instead of loading
 * a second address, which is what a struct-array subscript gives and two
 * parallel tables would not.
 *
 * The tail is sub_080755F0's minus the target1_enable_bd clear -- the `& 0xFFE0`
 * with no OR, then the `& 0xE0FF | 0xF00`, both folded into one `ldrh`/`strh`
 * pair, and target2_enable_bd set as a single bit on byte 1. */
