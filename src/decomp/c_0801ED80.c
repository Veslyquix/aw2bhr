 * THE PROLOGUE IS THE INTERESTING PART. `sub sp, #4` before the push, followed
 * by `str r3, [sp,#0x20]` and an immediate reload, is not a spill and not
 * varargs -- agbcc's varargs prologue is `push {r2, r3}`, which was measured
 * and does not appear here. It is a 64-bit parameter straddling the
 * register/stack boundary: the low word arrives in r3, the high word in the
 * caller's first stack slot, and gcc reserves a home slot so the two are
 * contiguous. agbcc annotates the reload `created by
 * thumb_load_double_from_address`. That also accounts for the THIRD stack read
 * at 0x28, which six `int` parameters cannot produce.
 *
 * The 0/-1 tail is written as an if/else and not as `-(x != 0)`: the ROM
 * presets one value and branches over the other, which is the spelling a
 * returned comparison cannot produce. -1 is CSEd with the seventh argument, so
 * both must be written as the same literal. */
