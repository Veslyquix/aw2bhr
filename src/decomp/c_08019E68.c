/* Promoted from assembly; each function below is byte-for-byte
 * identical to the original. Order is address order and must
 * stay that way -- the linker places this file's .text as one
 * contiguous block at 0x08019E68.
 * sub_08019E68 @ 0x08019E68
 */

/* Builds the option list: walks the 0x20-byte entry table until the 0xff
 * terminator, asks each entry's unk04 predicate whether it is available,
 * records every answer in unk24[] and every AVAILABLE entry's index in
 * unk31[], then sizes the window from the widest label and draws it.
 *
 * `w` starts at 0x10 and grows 0x10 per available entry; it reaches
 * sub_0801A444 as `w >> 3`, i.e. in tiles. `maxw` is the widest label in
 * pixels and arrives as `(s16)(maxw + 2)`.
 *
 * The counter `n` is `s16` and that is what the two shift pairs around it are:
 * agbcc's PROMOTE_MODE stores a narrow local zero-extended (`lsls #0x10;
 * lsrs #0x10`) and sign-extends it at each use (`lsls #0x10; asrs #0x10`), so
 * seeing both around one `++` is one variable, not two. `p->unk20` is RELOADED
 * every iteration because the indirect call through unk04 may have moved it. */
