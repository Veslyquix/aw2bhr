 * sub_08051BEC @ 0x08051BEC
 */

/* MATCHED. The near-twin of sub_08051F4C -- same install sequence, differing
 * in the sub_08015410 blob (gUnknown_085536A4), the gUnknown_08553B10 table,
 * an extra sub_08015504 call, the 0x180 rather than 0x100 handed to
 * sub_080157F4, and the tail. See sub_08051F4C for the `f`, `c`/`d` and
 * pointer-local notes; all three carry over except that this one needs no
 * `row` local, because its gUnknown_085D6A48 read is column 0 and has no
 * constant to misplace.
 *
 * The tail is an indirect call through gUnknown_08552FB8 column 1, indexed
 * `[gUnknown_085D6A48[gUnknown_03004580[a][1]][0]][gUnknown_03004580[a][2]]`
 * -- the same `[w][q][c]` shape sub_0804D290/sub_0804DCA8 use on column 2.
 * `bl _call_via_r3` is ordinary compiler output for a three-argument indirect
 * THUMB call, not a veneer.
 *
 * `entries[b].unk00 = entries[b].unk01;` and NOT `= 1`, which is the one place
 * this function and sub_08051F4C disagree on an identical-looking statement.
 * Both are semantically the same under the `unk01 == 1` guard, and each
 * matches only its own function -- probed both ways in both functions, and the
 * literal costs a surplus `movs r0,#1` here while the member read costs an
 * `adds r2,r3,#0` there. The cause is visible in the listing: here the second
 * `unk01` test is a fresh `ldrb` (the indirect call in between clobbers
 * memory), so cse's "r0 holds 1 on this edge" equivalence is still free to
 * supply the store; in sub_08051F4C the two tests share one load and the
 * register is committed. Do not "clean this up" to make the siblings look
 * alike -- it is a measured difference, not a transcription choice. */
