 * unk2c is a `u8 (*)(void)`: the ROM calls it through `bl _call_via_r1` with no
 * argument register set up -- r1 is simply where the pointer already sat, so the
 * register index is NOT the arity readout here -- and truth-tests the result
 * after `lsls #0x18`, which is what makes the return `u8`.
 *
 * The predicate arm is the FALLTHROUGH and the null arm is the branch target,
 * so the `if` has to be spelled `f != NULL` with the plain call in the `else`.
 * Spelled the other way round the two arms swap and the second sub_08078540
 * lands on the wrong side of the literal pool, which is -4 bytes of alignment. */
