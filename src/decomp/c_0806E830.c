 * its own countdown: while the counter is non-zero an Interpolate offset is
 * subtracted (left arrow) or added (right arrow) and the counter ticks down.
 *
 * The row offset `proc->unk60 * 3` is computed BEFORE the sub_0806E7FC call and
 * held in r7 for all three reads -- that is the source order, not scheduling.
 * `movs r0,#0x10` serves both `0x10 - counter` and Interpolate's fifth
 * argument; one constant, two uses.
 *
 * Both offsets are initialised to 0 above the two `if`s, and the second one
 * lives in r8 because it has to survive the first PutSprite. */
