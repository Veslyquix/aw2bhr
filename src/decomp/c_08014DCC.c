/* Promoted from assembly; each function below is byte-for-byte
 * identical to the original. Order is address order and must
 * stay that way -- the linker places this file's .text as one
 * contiguous block at 0x08014DCC.
 * HeapAlloc @ 0x08014DCC
 *
 * Not a Xenesis-documented name. The old sub_08014DCC symbol is kept as a
 * linker alias below so every other unit keeps resolving it unchanged.

/* Best-fit allocator for a heap laid out by sub_08014D7C. sub_08014E44 is the
 * wrapper that passes gUnknown_03000050; sub_08014E68 frees and sub_08014EF4
 * reallocates. The header layout is the one c_08014E68.c established.
 *
 * Rounds the request up to 16 bytes, walks the block list for the smallest
 * free block that fits, and splits off the remainder as a new free block when
 * it has room for a header plus 16 bytes. Returns the data after the header,
 * or NULL.
 *
 * Measured spelling notes:
 * - The split-off block reuses the scan cursor `p`, read back through
 *   `best->next`. That makes the ROM's `adds r2, r0, #0` copy and also keeps
 *   `p` and `next` in separate registers in the loop. With a separate `rest`
 *   local, `p = next` is coalesced away and the function is 8 bytes short.
 * - The first NULL return is early and the second falls through to the end.
 *   jump cross-jumps the two `movs r0, #0` exits into the trailing block,
 *   which leaves the guard as `bne <loop>; b <ret0>`. A goto to a shared
 *   `fail:` label for both exits gives `beq <ret0>; b <loop>` instead.
