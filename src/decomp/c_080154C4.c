/* Set one OBJ attribute bit on the slot's stashed attributes: fetch the eight
 * bytes into a stack local with sub_0801566C, poke one bitfield, hand them
 * back by value to sub_08015608. sub_08015504 is the SAME SOURCE one bit
 * along (`bpp`, `lsls #5`, mask ~0x20).
 *
 * The `movs r0,#0x11; rsbs r0,r0,#0` mask is the bitfield-store tell: it is a
 * 32-bit ~0x10, which is what an `o.mosaic = b` assignment produces. Spelling
 * the same thing by hand through a `u8 *` folds the mask to `movs r0,#0xef`
 * and comes out two bytes short.
 *
 * Both parameters are DECLARED NARROW even though the prologue is
 * copy-then-narrow. That shape is normally the `int`-with-a-cast tell, but it
 * is also what agbcc emits for a declared-narrow parameter whose pseudo lives
 * across a call -- assign_parms' incoming copy and the PROMOTE_MODE extension
 * stop fusing. Measured against `(int, int)` and `(int, u8)`; see the note in
 * include/unknown-functions.h.
