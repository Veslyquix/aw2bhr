 * The inner test must be spelled `<= 1` with the SUCCESS path as the `if` body
 * and `return 0` after it: the ROM's `cmp r0,#1; bhi <ret 0>` reaches the 0
 * from the conditional branch, so 0 is the FAR arm. Writing it the intuitive
 * way (`if (unk04 > 1) return 0;` then fall through) makes gcc emit `bls` plus
 * an extra `b` AND swaps the two arms of the outer test, because cross-jumping
 * then relocates the wrong block. Same instructions, mirrored layout.
 *
 * The tail `unk04++; return 1;` is written out in BOTH arms; cross-jumping is
 * what merges them, and the duplicated `ldrb r0, [r2, #4]` in each arm is the
 * proof it was two statements and not one shared one. Writing the tail once
 * after an `else if` chain needs a `continue` for the no-match case, and that
 * makes the loop optimiser replace the counter with a pointer end-compare
 * (`cmp r2, r3` against base + 0x78) -- the ROM keeps `i` in r3 against 0xf. */
