/* Promoted from assembly; each function below is byte-for-byte
 * identical to the original. Order is address order and must

/* Reached through gMap (include/map.h) rather than a local struct cast: a
 * member access computes base + offsetof first and then adds the scaled
 * index, which is the ROM's order -- see c_0800B1FC.c for the fuller version
 * of this note.
 *
 * The second index is written `rowOffset[..] + (unk00 + pos.unk00)` with the
 * parenthesis load-bearing: -fforce-addr materialises the rowOffset element's
 * ADDRESS when the left operand is expanded and defers the `ldrh` to the add,
 * so the two byte reads land between the address and the load exactly as the
 * ROM has them. Without the parentheses the sum reassociates and the `ldrh`
 * moves four instructions earlier. */
