/* Wave 50, W50-F. THREE parameters -- see the note on the declaration in
 * include/unknown-functions.h. The middle one is never read.
 *
 * Two spellings are load-bearing, and both are about where a constant offset
 * gets folded:
 *
 *  - The slot index MUST be spelled `gUnknown_02029808[a1].unk02[...]`, not
 *    through the gUnknown_0202980A overlay declared for the same address. With
 *    the overlay there is only ONE reference to the gUnknown_02029808 address
 *    constant in the loop, so agbcc folds `+0x30` into a second pool word
 *    (`gUnknown_02029808+0x30`) and the base pseudo dies in the preheader. With
 *    the member spelling there are two, the base becomes a loop invariant that
 *    LICM keeps and reload spills at [sp], and the unk30 access becomes
 *    `ldr r1,[sp]; adds r1,#0x30` -- which is what the ROM has, together with
 *    the fourth stack slot and the `adds r6,r1,#0` copy that keeps the base
 *    alive past r6.
 *
 *  - `row` must be a local. Written out as
 *    `gUnknown_085D6A48[gUnknown_03004580[a1][1]][2]` the +4 folds into the base
 *    (`adds r2,#4; ldrh r0,[r0]`); bound to a pointer first it stays a load
 *    displacement, `ldrh r2,[r0,#4]`, as in the ROM.
 *
 * The `= 1` store into gUnknown_02029B80 reuses the register the `== 1` test
 * loaded, which is why the ROM has no `movs #1` there.
