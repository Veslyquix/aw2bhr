/* The camera-relative twin of sub_08074C5C: the same `x - 0x50` clamped into
 * [0, 0xc0], but applied only when x falls outside the 0x50..0xa0 band around
 * the scroll origin, and otherwise passing the origin itself back.
 *
 * `gUnknown_081CC4D8` is NOT a global.  The ROM word there holds 0x0202FDFC --
 * checked against baserom.gba -- so it is agbcc's own `-fforce-addr` address
 * constant for &gUnknown_0202FDFC, and sub_08074C1C's `gUnknown_081CC4DC` is
 * the private second copy of the very same address.  The honest spelling names
 * the global and lets the build place the pool word.
 *
 * `v` is seeded from the origin and the SECOND test re-reads it, because the
 * first block may already have overwritten `v`; that is why the ROM has two
 * `ldrsh` off one address register rather than one.
