/* The multiplayer send step. It writes the caller's halfword into SIOMLT_SEND
 * and spins until the register reads back what it wrote, then either arms a
 * timeout (sub_0802ECEC) or starts the transfer directly by writing
 * gUnknown_03000560 | 0x6080 to SIOCNT.
 *
 * -4 when the session state gUnknown_0300055C is above 3; 5 otherwise, and the
 * whole middle is skipped unless that state is exactly 0.
 *
 * `0xc1 << 7` is 0x6080 and `0x80 << 4` is 0x800 -- write the constants and let
 * agbcc build them.
 *
 * ONE LOCAL, NOT TWO. The gate flag and the timeout value share a variable, and
 * that is what puts the timeout in r1 and costs the `adds r0, r1, #0` in front
 * of the call; two separate locals put it straight in r0 and the copy
 * disappears. Same wave-17 lesson in reverse -- here the ROM has FEWER locals
 * than the obvious spelling.
 *
 * The gate is spelled as a nested if/else and not as `a == 0 || b == 0 ||
 * c < 0`: the flat disjunction jumps all three ways straight into the body and
 * never materialises the flag, while the ROM sets it to 1 on the unk0a path and
 * falls into `cmp r1, #0`. The `else v = 1` being textually LAST is what makes
 * that block the fall-through; with the assignments in the other order agbcc
 * threads the first two and leaves the last one inline, which is the mirror
 * image of the ROM. */

 *
 * `dst` is WALKED, not indexed -- the ROM copies the parameter into its own
 * pseudo up front and every store is `*dst++`. Indexed `dst[0..3]` gives
 * base+displacement stores instead and loses the `adds r3, r1, #0`.
 *
 * gUnknown_02025C18 is `[cursor][slot]`: the ROM scales the two indices
 * separately (`lsls #1` on the slot, `lsls #3` on the cursor) and adds them to
 * the bare symbol. Flat `[cursor * 4 + slot]` reassociates and moves a shift.
 *
 * The cursor advance is TWO statements, `++` then `&= 0x3ff`, and each carries
 * the dead `ldrh` in front of its `strh` because gUnknown_03003128 is volatile.
 * Folded into one expression the middle load/store pair disappears.
 *
 * The `volatile u16 *p` local and the operand order of the compare are both
 * load-bearing and were found by decomp-permuter: without the local the two
 * scan givs land in r1/r2 instead of the ROM's r2/r5, and with the compare
 * written the other way round agbcc emits `cmp r0, r1` for the ROM's
 * `cmp r1, r0`. */
