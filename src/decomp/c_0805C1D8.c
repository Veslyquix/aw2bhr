/* The three-level `ldr rN,=<word>; ldr rM,[rN]; ldr rD,[rM]` is agbcc's own
 * -fforce-addr copy supplying the middle level, not a pointer-to-pointer: the
 * ROM word at 0x0816D9D4 holds 0x03004770, and its neighbours 0x0816D9D0 and
 * 0x0816D9D8 hold 0x03003F20 and 0x08499590, so the run is one unit's `.LC`
 * pool. sub_0805C208 next door names the same global with an ordinary
 * two-level `ldr`. Naming it honestly here reproduces all three levels.
 *
 * Both compares are UNSIGNED (`bls`, `bhi`), which is what makes the counter
 * u32 rather than int. The `movs r0, #1` in the first arm is BOTH the stored
 * value and the returned one -- agbcc reuses the register it already loaded. */
