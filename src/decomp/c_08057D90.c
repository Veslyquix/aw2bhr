/* Promoted from assembly; each function below is byte-for-byte

/* Scans the whole map for the reachable cell with the lowest cost byte and
 * writes its (x, y) back through the two out-parameters, after running two
 * map-plane setups and one indirect draw call.
 *
 * Uses `gMap` (include/map.h), the typed linker alias for `gUnknown_08499590`
 * -- but the two `sub_0801F92C` calls must pass `gMap->danger` /
 * `gMap->move` (the plane's OWN array member, which decays to the same
 * `u8 *` `sub_0801F92C` takes), not `gUnknown_08499590 + offset` or a
 * `(u8 *)gMap + offset` cast. agbcc's CSE unifies repeated loads of the SAME
 * symbol, not two symbols that happen to share an address, so every use in
 * the function has to name `gMap` for the compiler to reuse the one pointer
 * load; a leftover raw-symbol or cast spelling anywhere forces a second,
 * separate pool load and permanently breaks the match.
 *
 *  - the planes must be STRUCT MEMBERS. `gMap[0x12 + idx]` on a bare `u8 *`
 *    would fold 0x12 into ldrb's displacement (`ldrb r0,[r1,#18]`), where the
 *    ROM computes `(map + 0x12) + idx`; `gMap->unit[idx]` is the spelling
 *    that keeps the constant on the base. Same for +0x2D5A.
 *  - `map->rowOffset[y]` likewise: reassociating to `(map + y*2) + 0x417A`
 *    is the wrong way round.
 *  - `map` is bound INSIDE the innermost `if`, not before the loops: the ROM
 *    reloads the pointer once per accepted cell and CSEs the three uses
 *    within it. A binding outside the loops loads it once for the function.
 *
 * The loop counters are `s16` (the `lsl #16 / asr #16` biv) and the two winners
 * are `u16` locals in promoted SImode stack slots -- which is what makes
 * `bx = x` a zero-extending `lsrs` rather than a sign-extending `asrs`.
 *
 * MATCHED. */
