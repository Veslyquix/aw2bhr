 * r0 untouched looks like `pred(proc)`, but arity is invisible in a
 * pass-through and the answer is on the callee side: sub_08019850 is already
 * promoted as `bool8 sub_08019850(void)` (src/decomp/c_08019850.c). The
 * incoming r0 is simply dead across the call; r4 exists only to survive it.
 *
 * `lsls r0, r0, #0x18` before the `cmp` is sub_08019850's bool8 return being
 * narrowed, exactly as in the exemplar -- an int-returning predicate emits a
 * bare `cmp r0, #0`. */
