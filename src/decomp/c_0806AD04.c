#include "proc.h"
/* Starts one gUnknown_0858175C child per enabled roster row and seeds it: the
 * row id, a 2-bit mode, a 0x180-wide column chosen by the caller's parity, and
 * the row's count rendered as up to three decimal digits, most significant
 * first, into the child's +0x2c byte array (0xff = blank).
 *
 * THE ONE NON-OBVIOUS SPELLING. The 2-bit read at +0x02 is `ldrb [.,#2]`
 * followed by `lsls #0x1e; lsrs #0x1e`, while the 14-bit read at the SAME
 * offset is `ldrh [.,#2]; lsrs #2`. That pair looks exactly like a
 * `u16 lo : 2; u16 hi : 14;` bitfield and it CANNOT be one -- see the Bitfields
 * chapter of docs/agbcc-codegen.md, which this function is the worked example
 * for. Briefly: agbcc gives any struct containing a bitfield 4-byte size and
 * alignment, which takes gUnknown_0202F214's element from 4 bytes to 8 and the
 * index from `lsls #2` to `lsls #3`; and the one layout that keeps the stride
 * loads the enclosing word, giving `ldr` rather than `ldrb`. Nor is it `& 3`,
 * which is `movs #3; ands`. The `(u32)` is load-bearing -- as `int` the second
 * shift is `asrs`.
 *
 * gUnknown_0202F214's declared `u16 unk02` is left ALONE. This is a fact about
 * the access, not about the struct. NOTE for whoever takes sub_0806B120: that
 * function is this one's WRITER and its stores genuinely want the bitfield
 * declaration, which would break the two reads here. See work/sub_0806B120/.
 *
 * The digit loop's exit test is at the TOP and its backward branch is on a
 * DIFFERENT variable, which is a `while` whose body ends in a conditional
 * break, not a do/while: `bne` targets the `cmp r4, #0`, so falling out of the
 * `v == 0` test leaves the loop without re-testing i. */
