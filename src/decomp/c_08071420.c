 * Wave 38 (W38-A). The brief predicted this whole block would need old_agbcc
 * the way its two promoted neighbours sub_080713F8 and sub_08071564 do. It does
 * not: this is byte-for-byte under agbcc as built, and under old_agbcc too.
 * See the DISCRIMINATOR note in data/compiler-overrides.json -- only the two
 * siblings with a CALL in the loop body diverge.
 *
 * Straight pokeemerald/FE m4a source. Three things worth keeping:
 *   - `mplayInfo->ident++` reuses the register the guard's compare already
 *     loaded (`adds r0,r3,#1`), and the closing store is the CONSTANT, not the
 *     loaded value, so both ends share the one `.4byte 0x68736D53` pool word.
 *     That is why this reads `= MPLAY_ID_NUMBER` rather than needing the
 *     `u32 ident` local that sub_080713F8 does.
 *   - `volume / 4` splits across the loop guard: the u16 truncation is the
 *     parameter's PROMOTE_MODE normalisation at entry (`lsls r6,r2,#0x10`) and
 *     the divide is LICM-hoisted into the preheader (`lsrs r6,r6,#0x12`).
 *     Do not try to author that split -- it is written by the loop optimiser.
 *   - the single `ldrb r3,[r1]` feeds both the MPT_FLG_EXIST test and the
 *     `|= MPT_FLG_VOLCHG`. CSE, from the nested `if`.
 *
 * `mov r7,sb; mov r6,r8` is the five-plus-live-values frame, not a loop signal:
 * trackBits, volume/4, 0x80, 3, i, track and bit are live at once.
