/* Rebuilds the design-room item ring for one side (0 = terrain list,
 * 1 = unit list): clears every entry's bit 0, then lays out `limit` entries
 * starting at gActiveMap->ringIndex, each taking its item from the
 * side's list in gUnknown_0200B224 (both indices wrap). For side 0, a
 * `selected` code with an army bit pattern ORs that army into each item
 * and reloads the ring through sub_080077EC / sub_08007B74.
 *
 * Matching notes:
 *  - The item copy is written in BOTH editMode arms. The two identical
 *    `gUnknown_0200B224[list]` givs combine, which makes loop.c's
 *    strength reduction profitable against list's three increments (+1,
 *    -17, -20): that is the ROM's walking r3 pointer, initialised after
 *    the loop guard. jump.c then cross-jumps the two stores into one
 *    block. That merge point has two predecessors, so CSE loses the stored
 *    value and the army OR re-reads entry->itemId, as the ROM does.
 *  - army/armyIndex are declared before count/limit: that sets the order
 *    of the spilled stack slots (armyIndex sp+4, count sp+8, limit sp+12). */

/* Loads army `army`'s five design-ring items (two halfwords each, from
 * gUnknown_084887AC) into gUnknown_0200B224[9..13], then copies their
 * first halfwords into the ring slots starting at ringIndex + an offset
 * picked by `item`'s low five bits (8/6/14/10/11 -> 4..0; any other code
 * keeps the first loop's final i).
 *
 * Matching notes, all load-bearing:
 *  - The first loop is a goto loop, so loop.c never sees it; a real loop
 *    reduces (i - 9) * 10 and reverses. `dst = base + 9` through a separate
 *    `base` local gives the ROM's `ldr r0; adds r2,r0,#0; adds r2,#36`.
 *    The `do { } while (0)` around the two copies, and routing army * 2
 *    through `j`, fix the loop's register assignment.
 *  - The second loop counts j up and indexes through its own `k`: loop.c
 *    reverses j into the ROM's 4..0 counter and reduces
 *    gUnknown_0200B224[k] to the walking r4 pointer, in the ROM's
 *    preheader order. `i++` before `k++` orders the increments.
 *  - `n` is the ROM's dead `terrainListIndex + i` add; the one-trip while
 *    keeps it alive. */
