 * first table read uses the register while the second (after two calls) has to
 * reload -- that asymmetry is CSE, not two different expressions.
 *
 * The +0x60 value is a CONDITIONAL EXPRESSION and its polarity is a readout:
 * the ROM presets 0x10 and overwrites with 0x20 on the branch NOT taken, i.e.
 * the `!= 3` orientation. Written `== 3 ? 0x10 : 0x20` agbcc presets 0x20 and
 * inverts the branch -- same size, different bytes. */
