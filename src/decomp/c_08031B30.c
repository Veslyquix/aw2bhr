 * Wave 30, W30-A -- the BRANCH POLARITY is the whole difference and it is not
 * free to choose. `if (unk212 == 0) return 1; <copy>; return 0;` and the same
 * thing with an explicit `else` BOTH compile to `beq` with the copy inline and
 * the `movs r0,#1` out of line, because do_jump rewrites `x == 0` by swapping
 * its two labels. Only the `!= 0` spelling below leaves the compare
 * un-swapped, and it is also what splits the literal pool in two the way the
 * ROM does: three words before the copy block, two after `bx lr`. */
