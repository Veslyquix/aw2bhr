/* MATCHED (wave 52, W52-E), by decomp-permuter at iteration 553 from the 98.5%
 * hand draft. PROMOTION MUST CARRY THE POOL WORDS:
 *
 *     "rodata": ["0x0809099C", "0x080909A0"]
 *
 * then re-run tools/split_rodata.py and tools/gen_lds.py. gUnknown_0809099C
 * and gUnknown_080909A0 are agbcc's own -fforce-addr words for
 * gUnknown_08499590 and gUnits; the honest spelling names the
 * objects and the build places the two words (addends 0 and 4).
 *
 * THE WHOLE RESIDUAL WAS ONE REGISTER SWAP, and `(new_var = cx)` is what
 * closes it -- do not "clean it up". The 98.5% draft had
 *
 *     original            candidate
 *     mov r9, r0          mov sl, r0     <- cx
 *     mov sl, r0          mov r9, r0     <- cy
 *
 * plus the matching pair at the two uses. Writing the embedded assignment into
 * the first addend creates cx's reference at a point no statement boundary can
 * reach, which flips the two allocnos' priority order without moving either
 * definition. Measured alternatives, wave 52:
 *   - `gUnknown_0849957C + cy * 32 + cx` -- keeps the same registers and
 *     reorders the two uses instead. Worse.
 *   - swapping the `cx =` and `cy =` statements -- DOES flip r9/sl correctly,
 *     but then loads camY before camX. Trades 4 wrong bytes for 2.
 *   - declaration order of the two locals -- byte-identical either way. A
 *     local pseudo's allocno number comes from FIRST USE, not from
 *     expand_decl walking the declaration list.
 *
 * Two things were load-bearing before the permuter ever ran:
 *   - `cx`/`cy` hold the ALREADY-DOUBLED offsets and the address is
 *     `p + cx + cy * 32`. The exemplar's spelling (`cx = ... & 0xf` with
 *     `p + cx * 2 + cy * 64`, c_080223E0.c) sinks the doubling to the use as
 *     `lsls #2` / `lsls #7` and costs 4 bytes.
 *   - the guards must be ONE `||` chain with the drawing arm as the `else`;
 *     five separate `if (...) { blank; return; }` blocks lay the blank arm out
 *     after the drawing arm. */
