/* MATCHED in Wave 72, configured, 344/344 bytes and relocations exact.
 * PARKED at 95.6% before Wave 63. Wave 63 improved this to 98.0%, size EXACT
 * (344 bytes), 7 of 344 bytes differing, first difference at +0xb4, by fixing
 * the early pool-load
 * placement by binding the i * sizeof(struct Unk8553A1C) byte offset before
 * forming p and q.
 *
 * The old r8/r9 diagnosis is STALE: the current draft already parks `dst` in
 * r9 (sb) and `m` in r8, exactly like the ROM.
 * What remains after the Wave 63 head fix is only:
 *  - the two DESCENDING loops (the j != 0 arm) build their start address as
 *    `offset + dst` where the ROM builds `dst + offset`
 *    (`adds r1,r0,r3` vs the ROM's `adds r1,r3,r0`, and
 *    `lsls;mov;adds #0x40;adds` vs the ROM's `lsls;adds #0x40;mov;adds`).
 *    Both ASCENDING loops already match byte-for-byte, so it is specific to
 *    the reversed giv.
 *
 * Two spellings for the descending arm were TESTED and are worse, do not retry
 * them: a pointer walk (`q = dst + b; ... *q-- = v;`) hoists the address above
 * the zero-trip guard and adds two instructions, and `dst[b + 32 - k]` folds
 * `(b + 32) * 2` instead of distributing it. `dst[b - k + 32]` -- used here --
 * is the spelling that gets the instruction COUNT right.
 * 300 s of decomp-permuter (~15k iterations) took this from 93.0% to 95.6% and
 * contributed the `new_var` / `k` temporaries below; they are permuter output,
 * not a reading of the original, but they are worth 2.6%. A second 300 s pass
 * from the Wave 63 98.0% draft tried 15,041 candidates without improvement.
 *
 * The head IS settled and cost most of the work. gUnknown_08553A2C and the
 * pair four bytes further on are reached from ONE pool word, with the second
 * base arriving as `adds r0,#4`. That is cse.c's use_related_value, and it can
 * only fire on two constants derived from the SAME symbol, so:
 *   - declaring gUnknown_08553A30 as a second linker symbol emits a second
 *     pool word (tested: +4 bytes, 57.3%);
 *   - carving `s8 unk04; s8 unk05;` into struct Unk8553A1C reads them off a
 *     single base with `movs rI,#4 / ldrsb` instead of building base+4
 *     (tested);
 *   - `&gUnknown_08553A2C[i].filler_02[2]` splits the 4 as base+2 and index 2
 *     (tested).
 * The cast on the base pointer below is the one that produces the ROM's
 * `ldr =gUnknown_08553A2C / adds r6,r3,r0 / adds r0,#4 / adds r3,r3,r0`, and
 * it also fixes the ldrsb addressing mode on both pairs.
 *
 * Wave 72's one distinct scheduling lever was the direct pointer spelling for
 * the descending stores: `*(dst + b - k)` (and `+ 32`). Unlike the previously
 * tested pointer walk, this keeps the zero-trip guard and reversed index shape
 * intact while making agbcc emit the ROM's base-plus-offset operand order. */
