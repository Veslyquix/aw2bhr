 * `sub_0802F534` returns s8 (src/decomp/c_0802F504.c) yet the call site narrows
 * `lsls #0x18; lsrs #0x18` -- that is PROMOTE_MODE holding the s8 pseudo
 * zero-extended, and every READ of it re-extends signed (`lsls #0x18; asrs`).
 * It is not a u8 return.
 *
 * The two `if`s are independent, not an else-chain: `gpKeySt->held` is reloaded
 * for the second test. `i` is s16, so each step runs in the HIGH half
 * (`lsls #0x10; adds <-0x10000>; lsrs #0x10`) and the wrap test reads the sign
 * of that word for free. The `-0x10000` pool word and the LICM-hoisted
 * `((s8)n << 16) - 0x10000` preheader are the loop optimiser's, not source. */
