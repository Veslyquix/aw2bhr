 * m4aMPlayModDepthSet. MATCHES -- but only under `old_agbcc`, and it now has an
 * entry in data/compiler-overrides.json, so `try_match` reports the match
 * directly. Wave 38 (W38-A).
 *
 * Same skeleton as sub_08071420 (see that file); the body writes `mod` at
 * +0x17 -- NOT modM at +0x16, and the neighbouring `mod`/`modM` pair is the one
 * place a layout quoted from memory slides everything by one. See the
 * MusicPlayerTrack block in include/unknown-globals.h for why +0x17 is settled.
 *
 * What the default compiler does differently. It gets 110 of 116 bytes (94.8%)
 * with the SIZE ALREADY EXACT, and the whole deficit is two independent 3-byte
 * deltas inside the loop body, neither reachable from the C:
 *
 *   - the ROM emits `movs r0,#0x80` BEFORE `ldrb r1,[r4]`; agbcc emits the
 *     ldrb first. Pure scheduling.
 *   - the re-read of the just-stored `track->mod` lands in r1 under old_agbcc
 *     (`mov r1,sb; cmp r1,#0`) and in r0 under agbcc (`mov r0,r9; cmp r0,#0`)
 *     -- and r0 is the register the `bl sub_08071564` two instructions later
 *     needs for its argument.
 *
 * Both compilers agree on everything else, INCLUDING substituting the stored
 * register for the `track->mod` re-read rather than reloading it (the value is
 * copied into a high register in the preheader and the test reads the copy).
 * So this is NOT the sub_080713F8 store-substitution difference; it is purely
 * the allocator, and the trigger is a call inside the loop body. Three siblings
 * in the same block with no call in the body match under both compilers.
 *
 * The `if (!track->mod)` spelling is the pokeemerald one and is what produces
 * the preheader copy. Keep it -- do not rewrite it as `if (!modDepth)`.
