/* MATCHED (wave 38, W38-E) via decomp-permuter, 66 iterations from the 96.3%
 * hand draft. Parked since an earlier wave at size-exact with 6 bytes differing.
 *
 * THE RESIDUAL WAS THE ALLOCNO TIE-BREAK BETWEEN x AND y, and the lever is
 * REUSING ONE LOCAL AS THE SCRATCH FOR THE OTHER'S COMPUTATION:
 *
 *     y = a1 - 0x10;        <- y's pseudo is created FIRST, holding x's value
 *     x = (u16)y;
 *     y = (u16)(a2 - 0x10);
 *
 * rather than the symmetric `x = (u16)(a1 - 0x10); y = (u16)(a2 - 0x10);`,
 * which puts x in r5 and y in r4 -- the ROM's assignment reversed. The earlier
 * park had ruled out declaring y before x and moving `proc`'s declaration, and
 * was right that DECLARATION order is not the lever: gcc 2.9 creates these
 * pseudos at first REFERENCE. Naming y first in an assignment is what moves the
 * reference, and no reordering of the declarations can reach it.
 *
 * This is the wave-37 "reuse an existing local rather than a fresh name inverts
 * depending on the exit test" rule showing up as a lever rather than a
 * preference, and it is also the confirmation that the permuter DOES reach
 * pure register-allocation residuals -- see docs/agbcc-codegen.md.
 *
 * sub_0807548C is the re-entry twin (src/decomp/c_0807548C.c): identical
 * coordinate head -- see that file for why the parameters are s16 and the
 * locals are s16-with-an-explicit-(u16) -- and an identical blend tail, but it
 * Proc_FINDs the already-running gUnknown_086143B8 proc instead of starting
 * one, tests its third argument against 1 rather than 2, and slides the
 * existing +0x2a/+0x2c pair up into +0x2e/+0x30 before writing the new target
 * into +0x32/+0x34: the old destination becomes the new origin, which is what
 * makes c_08075368.c's Interpolate arms read +0x2e..+0x34 as two endpoint
 * pairs. Those two extra field-to-field copies, which sub_0807548C does not
 * have, are exactly what consumed the r1 scratch and shifted the tie-break.
