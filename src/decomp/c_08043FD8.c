/* Matched wave 43 (W43-J), after three waves parked at 50.0%. Two facts, both
 * unreachable from the four-fresh-locals draft this replaces:
 *  - the results are written BACK to the parameters, as the already-matched
 *    sibling sub_08043C28 does. That is what makes agbcc keep the incoming y
 *    in r7 and emit the ROM's push {r4, r5, r6, r7, lr};
 *  - the low half must be the OR's LEFT operand. With fresh locals the two
 *    orders compile identically (W43-H measured that correctly); with the
 *    write-back they differ by a four-register rotation.
 * See the W43-J chapter in docs/agbcc-codegen.md. */
