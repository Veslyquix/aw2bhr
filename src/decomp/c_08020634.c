/* Reverses the byte string [dst, end) in place through a 20-byte stack buffer

 *
 * The copy-back loop is peeled by hand in the source: the first byte is stored
 * before the loop and the loop test reads `*dst` back.  That read is what the
 * `lsls #0x18; lsrs #0x18` pair is -- global CSE forwards the just-stored
 * QImode value from both predecessors into the shared test block and has to
 * re-extend it there.  Testing a `u8` local instead folds the extension into
 * the `ldrb` and lets cross-jumping sink the `strb` into the test block, which
 * is 4 bytes short and one instruction out of place.
 *
 * `i++` must be its own statement after the store: written as `buf[i++]` the
 * `movs r4, #1` schedules ahead of the `strb` and cross-jumping fires again. */
