 * ONE binding local for both sprite pointers, not two. Written as two separate
 * locals (or inline as `owner->unk4c->unk3c`), the second pointer picks up r1
 * instead of re-using r2 and the function misses by that register alone, size

 * on one hard register, where two pseudos are free to land anywhere. */
