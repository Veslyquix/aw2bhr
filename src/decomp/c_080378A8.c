/* MATCHED, wave 50 (W50-L), second try_match attempt.
 *
 * Redraws the whole minimap: for every visible cell copy a four-halfword tile
 * quad into the caller's buffer, and tally the terrain types seen. Cells
 * outside the map get a blank quad. Sibling of sub_08037A78, which builds its
 * destination the same way (`a1 + xtable[x] + ytable[y]`, both scaled by 2)
 * and reads the same gUnknown_080A0F38 tile pool.
 *
 * `gUnknown_0849D474` appears TWICE with unrelated meanings -- once to pick a
 * tile id, once as the x-offset table -- because the tables are contiguous in
 * one ROM blob and agbcc CSEs the single base register across both. That is
 * what the ROM does; it is not a transcription slip.
 *
 * THREE READOUTS, EACH WORTH AN ATTEMPT.
 *
 * 1. The BLANK-TILE arm is emitted FIRST, so the source tests the negated
 *    condition: `if (x >= buf[0] || y >= buf[1]) src = blank; else {...}`.
 *    Written the positive way round agbcc lays the big arm inline and the
 *    blank arm after it, which moves the gUnknown_0849D434 pool word out of
 *    the first literal pool. Read the pool order backwards to spot this.
 * 2. `hi = b >> 5` is its own statement BEFORE the switch -- the ROM computes
 *    it into r2 between the `ldrb` and the first `cmp`. Folded into the
 *    expression after the switch it lands after the `ldrh`, one slot late.
 *    The switch value must be UNSIGNED (`bhi`, not `bgt`), and the case bodies
 *    are laid out 0xe, 6, 0xa, 0xb, which is their source order: the last test
 *    of agbcc's decision tree falls straight into the FIRST case body, so 0xe
 *    is inline with a `bne` to the default while the other three are jumped to.
 * 3. The header pointer needs the exemplar's two-statement form
 *    (`p = (u16 *)buf; p += off + x;`). Written as one expression the operands
 *    of the final add come out reversed -- `adds r0, r0, r5` where the ROM has
 *    `adds r0, r5, r0` -- which is a size-exact 99.5% and was the last byte to
 *    fall. Same rule as readout 3 of src/decomp/c_080377C4.c.
 *
 * `w` and `h` are UNSIGNED, not u8: `(buf[0] - w) >> 1` is a `lsrs`, and both
 * `w++` and `h++` are bare `adds` with no re-truncation. The `(u8)` cast on the
 * `h` bound is real and asymmetric with `w` on purpose -- `w` lives in r6 so
 * combine folds its cast away against the `ldrb`, while `h` is spilled to
 * [sp,#4] in between, which breaks the chain and leaves the `lsls #24; lsrs
 * #24` pair standing. `x` and `y` are u16, truncated at each increment.
 *
 * The four counters are zeroed through `off` rather than a literal: agbcc parks
 * the constant in r8, which is where `off` then lives, and the ROM's
 * `movs r0,#0; mov r8,r0; mov r1,r8` round trip is exactly that. */
