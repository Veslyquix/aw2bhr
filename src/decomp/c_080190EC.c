/* The gUnknown_0200C528 cursor-advance family again, one step further than
 * src/decomp/c_0801903C.c: same `s16` parameter, same hoisted `g[i].unk04` row,
 * same `p++` on the 0x10-byte node, with a call that reads the node first.
 *
 * The `(s16)` cast on `unk08` is NOT evidence that the member is signed, and
 * the member stays `u16`. Probed: `p->unk08` on the u16 member emits the
 * one-instruction `ldrh r0, [r0, #8]`, while `(s16)p->unk08` folds the
 * truncate-then-sign-extend into the ROM's two-instruction register-offset
 * `movs r1, #8; ldrsh r0, [r0, r1]` -- byte-identical to declaring the member
 * `s16`. So an `ldrsh` at a member offset does not prove a signed member, and
 * c_08018C54.c's `ldrh` on the same member is left undisturbed. */
