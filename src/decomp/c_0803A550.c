/* MATCHED, wave 43 (W43-I), first attempt.
 *
 * Blanks the whole 0x400-entry halfword buffer gUnknown_08499578 points at,
 * then kicks the four consumers.
 *
 * THE COUNTER IS `s16`, and the loop bottom says so in one shot: the increment
 * keeps BOTH halves -- `lsrs r1, r0, #0x10` for the next iteration's value and
 * `asrs r0, r0, #0x10` for the `<= 0x3ff` compare -- while the body re-reads it
 * `lsls #0x10; asrs #0x10`. A `u16` gives `lsrs` in both places and an `int`
 * gives neither pair.
 *
 * gUnknown_08499578 is a POINTER global and is re-`ldr`ed every iteration
 * (`ldr r2, [r5]` inside the loop). Do not bind it to a local -- same rule as
 * gUnknown_0849957C in c_08037B90.c. */
