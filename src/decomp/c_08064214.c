/* Composes three axis rotations into one matrix and transforms the eight
 * gUnknown_0202F140 vectors by it.
 *
 * The three 0x30-byte matrices are plain `int[12]` frame slots, which is what
 * `sub sp, #0x90` and the `mov r0, sp` / `add rN, sp, #0x30` / `#0x60`
 * argument setup say. They are CAST at each call rather than declared with the
 * callees' struct tags: struct Mtx43, Unk64034Mtx, Unk6407CMtx and Vec3 are all
 * defined file-locally in src/decomp/ (c_08063DDC.c, c_08064034.c) and are only
 * forward-declared in include/unknown-functions.h, so this unit cannot name a
 * complete one -- and defining its own copy is exactly what c_08064034.c's
 * header comment warns breaks a promote.py merge. The casts are byte-neutral.
 *
 * The parameters are `int`, not `s16`: each is copied whole in the prologue
 * (`adds rN, r0, #0`) and only then narrowed with `lsls #0x10; asrs #0x10` at
 * its own call, which is copy-then-narrow -- an `s16` parameter would have been
 * narrowed once at entry.
 *
 * sub_08063E28 is called with its second and third arguments the same pointer,
 * so it composes in place; the two calls chain m0*m1 into m1 and m1*m2 into m2,
 * leaving m2 as the one the loop uses. */
