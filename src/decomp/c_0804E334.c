/* Re-bases a stashed OBJ tile index against the slot's current one and, when it

 * THE PARAMETER IS NOT A `struct OamData *`. The ROM reads +4 with a plain
 * `ldrh`, subtracts, and masks the DIFFERENCE with 0x3ff; and it re-inserts with
 * `movs r0, #0xfc; lsls #8; ands` -- a 16-bit 0xfc00 mask and an `adds`.
 * Through OamData's `tileNum : 10` bitfield agbcc extracts the field on the read
 * side too and masks with the 32-bit 0xfffffc00 on the write side, which is four
 * bytes wrong. The stack copy sub_0801566C fills IS an OamData -- its tileNum
 * read is the `lsls #0x16; lsrs #0x16` extract -- so the two objects are
 * deliberately typed differently here.
 *
 * The `-` and `&` are folded: masking the difference with 0x3ff makes the
 * high bits of the left operand irrelevant, so agbcc never masks it. */
