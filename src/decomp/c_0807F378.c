/* The only member of this family with any control flow: a 16-iteration
 * `sub_08071AF0(i, 0, proc)` loop (signed `cmp #0xf; ble`, so `i` is `int`),
 * then the usual straight run.
 *
 * `proc` is `ProcPtr` because sub_08071AF0 forwards its third argument to
 * sub_08071B28 in r3, which hands it to Proc_Start as the parent -- exactly
 * sub_08071B0C's shape. The prologue is bare, so it is a full word either way.
 *
 * `gUnknown_03002020 = gUnknown_03002020;` and the same for 03002B28 are real
 * volatile self-stores: only a volatile lvalue emits the bare ldrh/strh pair to
 * one address.
 *
 * The target1 group insert was probed BOTH ways -- `.raw` and
 * `*(u16 *)&gUnknown_030030E0` -- and they are byte-identical here. */
