/* Family F045: `push {lr}; lsls r1,#0x18; lsrs r1,#0x18; ldr r0,=g;
 * str r1,[r0]; bl sub_0801A168; bl <second>; pop {r0}; bx r0`.
 *
 * The `lsls`+`lsrs` pair is a VALUE-KEPT narrowing (not a truth test) sitting
 * before any use, i.e. PROMOTE_MODE re-narrowing a declared `u8` parameter --
 * and it is on r1, the SECOND argument register. So the signature has two
 * parameters and the first one is dead in the body. The store is `str`, a
 * word, so the global is wider than the parameter feeding it; see the
 * gUnknown_030040F0/gUnknown_030044A0 comment in unknown-globals.h.
 *
 * THE FIRST PARAMETER IS NOT PROVED. A dead leading parameter is invisible,
 * and `void *` is chosen only because these functions are callback slots
 * (+0x14 and +0x18) of the 0x20-byte records at gUnknown_0849AC60 /
 * gUnknown_0849ABC0. The sibling slots do not settle it either: sub_0802C604
 * (+0x04) and sub_0802C65C both ignore r0 as well.
 *
 * The two `bl`s are two statements: the second callee never reads r0 before
 * writing it, so a nest is not expressible in C. */
