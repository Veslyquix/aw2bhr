 * `lsl #16` before the compare, and combine folds the matching `lsr #16` into
 * the `>> 1` to give the `lsr #17` inside the branch. Declaring the local
 * `int` and casting at the shift instead keeps the value un-narrowed, turns
 * the unsigned `bhi` into a signed `bgt` and drops the shift pair entirely.
 *
 * The two register writes share one pool word and an `adds r0, #4`: agbcc CSEs
 * the second absolute address against the first.
