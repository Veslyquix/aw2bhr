/* Copies the whole 20-byte key state into one of three slots of
 * gUnknown_03002040 -- slot 1 on L (0x200), slot 2 on R (0x100), slot 0 when
 * neither is held. 20 bytes is exactly sizeof(struct KeySt), which is what
 * identifies the slots; the three ldm/stm pairs are one struct assignment.
 *
 * The destination pointer is bound INSIDE each arm rather than once at the top.
 * That is the whole difference: a function-scope binding gets the ROM's
 * one-pool-word shape (`ldr r1, =gUnknown_03002040` then `adds r1, #0x14`) but
 * keeps the base live across all three arms and pays two `adds rN, r3, #0`
 * copies, where the ROM reloads the pool word in each arm. A block-scope
 * binding dies at the end of its arm, so each arm re-materialises it. Spelling
 * the destination as a cast subscript or a byte offset instead --
 * `((struct KeySt *)&gUnknown_03002040)[1]` or
 * `*(struct KeySt *)((u8 *)&gUnknown_03002040 + 0x14)` -- folds base and offset
 * into a symbol+addend relocation and emits THREE pool words with no adds
 * (both measured, wave 34). */
