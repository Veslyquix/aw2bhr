 * rather than one wider field.
 *
 * sub_0801E18C TAKES THE INDEX, and this function is one of the three that
 * measure it: r0 is never rewritten, and the record address goes to r4 with
 * the pool word in r5 -- two callee-saved registers pushed by a function that
 * has nothing to keep across the call. Declared `sub_0801E18C(void)`, agbcc
 * reuses the dead r0 for the address, drops to `push {r4, lr}`, and misses. */
