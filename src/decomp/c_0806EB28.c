/* Picks the next of four palettes, skipping whichever one the proc already has,
 * and applies it. gUnknown_08582754 is an array of POINTERS, not palette data:
 * the `lsls #2` index is followed by a LOAD through the result.
 *
 * The `if` has no else and its body FALLS THROUGH between the `bne` and the
 * label, which is the ordinary guard shape -- unlike the joining `if/else`es
 * elsewhere in this block, there is nothing here for an out-of-line arm to be.
 *
 * The parameter must stay `ProcPtr` because include/unknown-functions.h already
 * declares it that way and both callers in src/decomp/c_0806EB5C.c pass
 * differently-typed procs; the cast to a layout is free. */
