/* MATCHED in wave 60 (W60-A) BY THE PERMUTER, after being parked since wave 30
 * as an unreachable local-alloc tie-break. The permuter had never been run on
 * it; it found this in 219 iterations of a single 300 s run.
 *
 * THE LEVER IS THE `do { ... } while (0)` AROUND THE TWO STORES. It is what
 * gives the handle r2 and the script base r3 (the ROM's assignment) instead of
 * the other way round -- the wave-30 park had ruled out every reordering and
 * retyping of the two values themselves, but not a statement grouping that
 * changes where their live ranges end. DO NOT TIDY IT: unwrapping the block is
 * the exact edit that puts the ten bytes back.
 *
 * Everything the wave-30 park settled still holds: `/ 2 * 2` is `lsrs #1;
 * lsls #1` and NOT `x & ~1` (which costs a register for -2), and the second
 * parameter is the entry INDEX into the script's table. sub_0801C640 next door
 * is the same axis and the same lever. */
