 * PROMOTION NEEDS A .rodata POOL WORD PLACED:
 *   "rodata": ["0x0812A140"]   (then split_rodata.py + gen_lds.py)
 * 0x0812A140 is an agbcc -fforce-addr address constant holding 0x03001FBC,
 * i.e. &gUnknown_03001FBC -- one more member of the 0x0812Axxx run
 * unknown-globals.h documents, and NOT an object. The honest spelling
 * `sub_08015C30(gUnknown_03001FBC)` is what produces it, and it appears in the
 * FIRST arm only: there the address must survive a call inside the loop and so
 * lands in a callee-saved register. The second arm's identical call gets a
 * plain inline pool word.
 *
 * The cursor is s16 and the scan DESCENDS: `ldrb p->unk1f; lsls #0x10;
 * asrs #0x10` with a `blt` exit, and the decrement re-narrows to u16 before the
 * next sign-extending read. gUnknown_03001FBC is declared s16 and sub_08015C30
 * takes u8, so the narrowing folds into the `ldrb` -- there is no cast in the
 * source. `sel` is deliberately read after a loop that may not have run; the
 * ROM does the same (r5 is undefined on the zero-trip path).
