/* The full "a cell changed" refresh, and the widest of the family: it is
 * sub_0800AF74's list (sub_0800A588 / sub_0800ABD0 / sub_08007F9C /
 * sub_0800BEE4) with sub_0800CFDC in front of it, wrapped in two guards.
 *
 * The struct is c_0800C22C.c's / c_0800AF24.c's, copied verbatim.
 *
 * `(u16)(cells[off] - 0x86) <= 1` in the ROM is fold_range_test's output for
 * the source's `cells[off] == 0x86 || cells[off] == 0x87` -- do not author the
 * subtract.  The whole guard is therefore
 * `86 || 87 || terrain != 4`, and the `beq` on terrain == 4 is the only path
 * that skips the re-tile block.
 *
 * `off` is one binding local and stays one: the ROM keeps rowOffset[y] + x in
 * r3 across the u16 cells load and reuses it for the u8 terrain load, so the
 * two accesses share the index rather than recomputing it. */
