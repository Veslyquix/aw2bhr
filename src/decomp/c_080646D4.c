/* MATCHED. Representative of family F092 (sub_080646D4, sub_08064FC8,
 * sub_08065118), the per-frame tick of a falling/arcing effect object: count
 * down a delay, then read the next vertical offset out of a ROM curve, hand
 * the object to its emitter, and when the curve runs out decrement the owner's
 * live count and end the whole effect.
 *
 * The one spelling that is not free is the ADDEND ORDER in the unk2a
 * assignment: `obj->unk38 + table[obj->unk26]` and not the other way round.
 * agbcc issues the two loads in the reverse of the order the addends are
 * written, so the natural table-first phrasing puts the unk38 load first and
 * swaps the operands of the final `adds`. Same effect, same length, different
 * bytes.
 *
 * The three `ldrsh` reads are what typed unk24/unk26 signed in
 * unknown-globals.h; see the note there. `obj->unk24--` still emitting `ldrh`
 * on a signed member is the documented "the sign bits cannot survive the
 * strh" narrowing and is not a contradiction. */
