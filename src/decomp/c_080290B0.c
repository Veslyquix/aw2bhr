/* MATCHED -- wave 60 (W60-D).  384/384 bytes.
 *
 * PROMOTION REQUIREMENT: needs its .rodata pool word PLACED.  The
 * data/promoted.json entry must carry  "rodata": ["0x08090B5C"]  and
 * tools/split_rodata.py + tools/gen_lds.py must be re-run before building.
 * That word is the -fforce-addr address constant for gUnknown_08499590;
 * trymatch reports it as "different symbols that resolve to the same address"
 * and calls it a match.
 *
 * THE WHOLE RESIDUAL WAS TWO DECLARATION INITIALISERS.  The wave-36 park
 * classified this as a pure three-way permutation of the high registers --
 *      ROM   dx -> ip,  dy -> r8,  force-addr word -> sb
 *      draft dx -> r8,  dy -> sb,  force-addr word -> ip
 * -- and called the draft "INSTRUCTION-EXACT".  IT WAS NOT.  `s16 dx = 0;` and
 * `s16 dy = 0;` as declaration initialisers make agbcc emit
 *      movs r0,#0 ; mov r8,r0 ; mov sb,r0
 * BEFORE the `bl sub_08022AAC`, where the ROM emits it AFTER.  Writing them as
 * plain statements after the call:
 *      sub_08022AAC(a1, a2);
 *      dx = 0;
 *      dy = 0;
 * moves the initialisation past the call and the entire three-cycle unwinds by
 * itself -- dx takes ip, dy takes r8, the pool word takes sb, and nothing else
 * in the function had to change.  Confirmed by compile_probe on both spellings
 * side by side before any try_match was spent.
 *
 * WHY, and this is the general rule (now in docs/agbcc-codegen.md): all three
 * pseudos tie on reference count, so global_alloc's allocno_compare decides
 * them on priority = log2(refs)*refs/LIVE_LENGTH.  A local initialised in its
 * DECLARATION has its live range start at block entry -- ahead of any call
 * that precedes its first real use -- which inflates allocno_live_length and
 * DROPS its priority.  Only one call-clobbered high register exists (ip), so
 * the highest-priority allocno takes it and the other two are pushed onto the
 * callee-saved pair.  Lengthening dx's range by a handful of insns is enough
 * to hand ip to the pool word instead.
 *
 * READ BACKWARDS THIS IS A CHEAP DIAGNOSTIC: if a candidate is size-exact and
 * differs only by which high register holds what, check whether any competing
 * local is initialised in its declaration while the ROM initialises it after a
 * preceding call.  Do not reach for the permuter first -- decomp-permuter ran
 * 4 x 300 s here (chained, each round from the previous best.c) and moved
 * nothing, because it never rewrites a declaration initialiser into a
 * statement.
 *
 * SETTLED, do not re-derive: the `*(u16 *)(gUnknown_08499590 + K)` spellings
 * (which avoid struct Map entirely and reproduce the ROM's three-level
 * force-addr chain), `s16` for dx/dy/cx/cy (the `lsls #16; asrs #16` at every
 * signed use is PROMOTE_MODE on an s16 LOCAL), and `/ 16` rather than `>> 4`.
