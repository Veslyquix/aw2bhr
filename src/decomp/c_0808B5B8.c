/* Program a whole save slot: walk sub_0808B540 across as many sectors as the
 * slot is bytes long, retrying each sector once. The 64-byte stack local is
 * the relocated read routine sub_0808AD6C copies out of ROM.
 *
 * MATCHED in wave 79 (W79-D) after thirty waves parked. NEEDS THE FLASH BLOCK'S
 * OVERRIDE -- -O2 AND -fforce-addr removed, -O1 added -- now recorded in
 * data/compiler-overrides.json. The entry had been missing since wave 47 even
 * though the parked note asserted it was there, and every measurement taken on
 * this function used --profile o1, which removes -O2 but KEEPS -fforce-addr.
 * That is not the configuration its thirteen neighbours use. Under the real one
 * the same source went 40.1% -> 99.0%, and the residual four waves had been
 * attacking -- agbcc duplicating the outer loop's exit test into a guard plus a
 * do/while, where the ROM jumps into the loop -- does not exist here at all. It
 * was an artefact of -fforce-addr.
 *
 * THE RETRY LOOP IS STILL ENTERED BY A JUMP INTO ITS BODY, past the countdown,
 * and is spelled with a goto for that reason; that lever was worth 12 bytes in
 * wave 47 and is kept.
 *
 * THE COMMA IN THE gUnknown_03005C7C STORE IS LOAD-BEARING. The ROM's two pool
 * words are gUnknown_03005C7C first and gUnknown_08485678 second, i.e. the
 * store's DESTINATION address is created before the source's. gcc's
 * expand_assignment expands the LHS before it calls store_expr on the RHS, so
 * binding slotInfo inside the RHS puts the destination first; as its own
 * preceding statement it puts the source first and swaps the pool pair. That
 * was the last 2 of 192 bytes. Do not tidy it into two statements.
 *
 * gUnknown_08485678 +0x18 is a 32-bit SLOT size and gUnknown_084856A4 +0x18 a
 * 32-bit SECTOR size -- the same offset in two records 0x2C apart, not one
 * record read twice. One local const u8 * per site: a single shared local gives
 * one long-lived pseudo where the ROM rematerialises the address per statement.
