/* The per-frame step of the proc sub_08073FF4 starts: four channels, each a
 * 16.8 position pair at +0x30 stepped by a velocity pair at +0x40, gated by
 * one bit of the +0x2c mask. The value handed to sub_08072C40 is the
 * position's integer part narrowed to a signed byte and then widened again
 * for that function's u16 parameters.
 *
 * The mask must be bound to a local. Written inline, `proc->unk2C & (1 << i)`
 * is folded by `fold` into `(proc->unk2C >> i) & 1` -- `asr r0, r0, r5;
 * movs r1, #1; ands` -- because the AND feeds a comparison against zero. A
 * VAR_DECL is opaque to that transform, so the shift stays on the constant
 * and lands ahead of the load, exactly as the ROM has it. Verified with
 * compile_probe both ways. */

 * agbcc's reversal of an ascending `for (i = 0; i < 8; i++)`, so the loop
 * runs 0..7 in the source.
 *
 * One induction variable serves both arrays: the ROM walks r1 from
 * proc + 0x30 and reaches the second array with the displacement 0x10, which
 * is what two 8-entry u16 arrays at 0x30 and 0x40 compile to. The source
 * pointer is stepped independently. sub_08073FA8 reads the same 0x30/0x40
 * bytes as four PAIRS of halfwords; both readings describe the same memory
 * and each function is spelled the way its own accesses read out. */
