/* The link handshake's per-frame step. gUnknown_03000574 is the state: 0 opens
 * the port and waits for SI to go low, 1 waits for the id exchange, anything
 * else just re-reports the last result.
 *
 * Two spellings are load-bearing:
 *
 *   - `/ 16` and not `>> 4`. Both are one `asrs`, but they build the AND with
 *     the operands the other way round: `(v & 0x30) >> 4` ties the AND's
 *     output to v's register (`ands r1, r0; asrs r0, r1, #4`) while the
 *     division ties it to the mask's (`ands r0, r1; asrs r0, r0, #4`), which
 *     is what the ROM has. agbcc only reaches the bare shift because
 *     nonzero_bits proves `v & 0x30` non-negative.
 *   - `int v` and not `u16 v`. A u16 keeps the mask in HImode, which zero-
 *     extends the `v & 4` store and turns this `asrs` into an `lsrs`.
 *
 * gUnknown_0300055C and gUnknown_03000564 are both volatile; see their notes
 * in unknown-globals.h. Three of the reloads here are the only evidence in the
 * ROM that 0x03000564 is. */
