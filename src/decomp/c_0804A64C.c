/* The index `i` is a u8 LOCAL, not a re-read of unk5d: the ROM keeps it in r4
 * across the `bl` and the clamp writes it back through `lsls #0x18; lsrs #0x18`,
 * which is a u8 assignment and not a cast at a use.
 *
 * `blo` (unsigned) on two u8 fields, so the clamp is `i >= unk5f`, and the
 * fixup value is `unk5f - 1` re-narrowed to u8.
 *
 * `lsls r0, r1, #4; subs r0, r0, r1` is a MULTIPLY by 15 -- agbcc's expansion
 * of `unk20 * 15`, not a hand-rolled shift-and-subtract.
 *
 * gUnknown_030044E0 is spelled out at every use rather than bound to a local:
 * the ROM keeps only the ADDRESS in r5 across the `bl` and reloads the pointer
 * afterwards (`ldr r1, [r5]`), which is what a global read on both sides of a
 * call compiles to. A local pointer would have survived the call in a
 * callee-saved register instead. */
