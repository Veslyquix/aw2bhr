/* MATCHED, and the first of a byte-identical pair with sub_08067358. A blend
 * proc tick: publish the blend coefficients for this frame, interpolate the
 * next one, and break when the ramp is finished.
 *
 * Two spellings are load-bearing and both were probe rounds:
 *
 *  - `(g & 0xFFE0) | ((unk3c << 4) | 0xF)` and NOT `... | (unk3c << 4) | 0xF`.
 *    The ROM ORs 0xF into the shifted field FIRST and merges the result into
 *    the masked global second; the flat left-to-right spelling reverses those
 *    two `orr`s.
 *  - `v = Interpolate(...); gUnknown_03001FFC = v;` and not the direct
 *    assignment. gUnknown_03001FFC is `volatile`, so the LHS address is forced
 *    into a register BEFORE the call is expanded, and it then needs a
 *    callee-saved home across it -- worth one extra saved register and a
 *    misplaced pool `ldr`. This is a new corner of the volatile note in
 *    hardware.h, which recorded the other eight users as byte-neutral because
 *    all of them store a CONSTANT; a call result is not byte-neutral.
 *
 * `.raw` and not `.bits`: the ROM has `ldrh` with a pool mask, which
 * hardware.h's union note reads as the HImode read-modify-write. */
