/* MATCHED byte-for-byte (wave 37, W37-Q2).

 * Rebuild gUnknown_03003F30[0..3]: "is slot i a live, present player?", with
 * slot 1 getting an extra escape hatch through sub_080781F0.
 *
 * The DUPLICATED `sub_08016D04(i)` is real source, not a compiler artefact.
 * agbcc never CSEs a call, so the two `bl sub_08016D04` in the stream are two
 * source calls; the first one's result is only ever used on the i == 1 path,
 * and the else arm fetches it again. Writing it once above the `if` and
 * letting both arms share it produces one `bl`, which is 12 bytes short.
 *
 * The three narrowings are all prototype-driven and none of them is a source
 * cast: sub_08016D04 returns s8 so its result is re-narrowed (`lsls #0x18;
 * lsrs #0x18` into the u8 `t`), sub_08016CD8 takes s8 so `t` is sign-extended
 * at the call (`lsls #0x18; asrs #0x18` -- and in the else arm agbcc folds
 * that onto the still-live shifted r0, which is why that arm is one
 * instruction shorter), and sub_08016E04 takes u16 so the already
 * zero-extended `t` goes through untouched.
 *
 * sub_080781F0's `lsls #0x18; lsrs #0x18` before the zero test is what forced
 * its return type from s32 to bool8 -- see include/unknown-functions.h and
 * src/decomp/c_08078198.c. An s32 return gives a bare `cmp r0,#0` here.
 *
 * `gUnknown_03003F30[1] = 0` really is the constant index 1 while the two
 * `= 1` stores are `[i]`: the ROM reaches the zero store with `strb r0,[r6,#1]`
 * (a folded displacement) but both one-stores with `adds r1,r5,r6` (a variable
 * index), and the two `= 1` sites are duplicated rather than shared, so this is
 * not agbcc const-propagating i == 1 in one place and not the other. The `0`
 * itself is r0 left over from the `cmp r0,#0` -- agbcc reuses a register it
 * knows holds zero instead of emitting `movs r0,#0`. */
