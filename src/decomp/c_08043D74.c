/* Clamps the sprite/terrain id 11 down to 10 and passes everything else

 *
 * The function is `int` and only the 0xa path executes a `return` statement.
 * The pass-through works by accident of the ABI: `a` is still sitting in r0
 * where the caller left it, so falling off the end returns it.  Every spelling
 * with an explicit `return a;` costs an instruction -- gcc then needs a real
 * pseudo for `a`, which loses r0 to the (u8) temp and pays `adds r0, r1, #0`
 * to put the value back.  Same shape as sub_08043DAC in this block, which is
 * also implicit-int with no return statement at all.
