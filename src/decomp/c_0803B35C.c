/* The setter twin of sub_0803B350 (src/decomp/c_0803B350.c), one slot along:
 * park the new value in gUnknown_030005CE, then push it to the m4a mixer as
 * sub_08071420's (MPlayVolumeControl) volume, with 0xFFFF as the track mask.
 *
 * TWO statements and not one. The ROM keeps &gUnknown_030005CE in r2 across the
 * `strh` and then re-reads the halfword out of it (`ldrh r2, [r2]`) to build the
 * third argument, which is the ordinary reload of a non-volatile global across
 * a statement boundary; spelling the argument as the parameter `a` instead
 * would drop the `ldrh` entirely. Nothing here is a volatile tell -- the
 * absolute-address chain is intact and the re-read does not survive a store to
 * a DIFFERENT address.
 * `int` parameter per the existing declaration: a bare `strh` is identical for
 * int/u32/u16/s16, and the prologue does not narrow r0.
 * `pop {r0}; bx r0` -> void. */

 *
 * `movs r4,#0x80; lsls r4,r4,#1` is a PLAIN constant 0x100, not wave 23's
 * named-constant-local: the shift is minimal (0x100 is not an imm8) and both
 * halves write the same register. r4 is a callee-saved register only because
 * the one constant feeds two consecutive calls. Likewise `ldr r2,=0xFFFF;
