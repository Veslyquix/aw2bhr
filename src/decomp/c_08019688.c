/* Skip `count` records in a byte stream, where a record ends at the first
 * `term` byte found by stepping `stride` at a time, and return the cursor just
 * past the last one. A leaf with two nested loops and no globals.
 *
 * The inner `while` is the rotated zero-trip form: the outer body loads *p and
 * branches straight to the `p++` when it already equals `term`, so the inner
 * block is only reached for a non-terminating byte. The `adds r1,#1` sitting
 * at the TOP of the outer body is that rotation too -- `i++` is scheduled into
 * the slot before the inner loop because r1 is dead across it -- and is not
 * evidence of a pre-increment in the source.
 *
 * `i` is `u8`, not `int`: the ROM re-truncates it (`lsls #0x18; lsrs #0x18`)
 * before every bottom test, which an `int` counter against a u8 bound does
 * not do. */
