/* One command of the gUnknown_03001470 script interpreter, the indirect-call
 * form: the command word is a handler address, the handler is passed the slot
 * itself, the cursor then steps one 8-byte command forward, and the slot's
 * unk00 decides the return.
 *
 * The handler is bound to a LOCAL before the call. That is load-bearing: as a
 * single call expression agbcc computes the slot address before loading the
 * handler and the two `ldr`s come out in the wrong order. See sub_08015E80 in
 * src/decomp/c_08015E80.c for why `gUnknown_03001470[a].unk04` is named twice
 * rather than bound to a pointer.
 *
 * The `!= 0` sense is read off the block order: the branch is taken to the
 * block AFTER the literal pool, and that block is `movs r0,#1`, so the
 * TRUE-returning arm is the one under the `if`. */
