/* Reports two byte counts through out-pointers.  For the 0xB4..0xBF range of
 * gPlaySt.mapID the answers are canned in gUnknown_020280C0's record;
 * otherwise it loads the map, tallies the properties on it per owner into a
 * six-byte scratch, and reports (largest single army's tally, total).
 *
 * The guard is the same fold range test sub_0802163C carries, but on a u8
 * member: build_range_check keeps unsigned char as the working type, so the
 * subtraction truncates -- `adds #0x4c; lsls #0x18; lsrs #0x18; cmp #0xb; bhi`
 * is `unk02 >= 0xb4 && unk02 <= 0xbf` and nothing else.  (+0x4c is -0xb4 mod
 * 256; the ROM's own `subs #0xb4` in the index below is the same constant.)
 *
 * The two canned bytes are gUnknown_020280C0[i].filler_14[5] and [6], i.e.
 * +0x19 and +0x1a.  They are left inside filler_14 deliberately: the only other
 * reader/writer, src/decomp/c_0803D3F0.c, already writes exactly those two
 * indices from a save record, so naming them would strand that file for no
 * byte-level gain.
 *
 * The clear loop, the inner map loop and the max loop all run on ONE local `x`.
 * Declaring a separate `i` for the two short loops costs 4 bytes: x and the
 * `y * 2` temp swap r3/r4 and the pool address then needs an extra `mov r0, ip`
 * to load through.  sub_080219AC in this same block needed the identical fix;
 * see docs/agbcc-codegen.md.

/* Rebuilds the two property lists from the map plane, in two passes over every
 * cell.  Pass one counts each army's properties into gUnknown_08499598[].unk11,
 * stamps the list index into the map's second 0x508-byte plane at +0x193A, and
 * fills gUnknown_084995A0[] with (terrain, x, y); pass two fills
 * gProperty[] with (raw cell, x, y).  Both lists are 0xFF-terminated,
 * and the second is capped at 0x5C entries -- the counter still advances past
 * the cap, so the terminator can land exactly at [0x5b].
 * The reset loop really is ascending: `subs r6,#1 / cmp r6,#0 / bge` at the
 * bottom is check_dbra_loop reversing an `x <= 4` counter whose only use is the
 * strength-reduced 0x3c byte stride.
 *
 * That reset loop runs on `x`, the SAME local as the inner map loop, and that
 * is worth 4 bytes: with a separate `i` declared, x lands in ip and
 * the map pointer in r6, which is the reverse of the ROM. Merging them adds
 * the reset loop's references to x's allocno and moves it ahead of the address
 * constant they were tying with. sub_08021810 in this same block needed the
 * identical fix; see docs/agbcc-codegen.md.
 *
 * Case 16 in pass two falls THROUGH into the main group when
 * gPlaySt.gameMode == 5; the ROM's `bne` to the skip label plus a
 * fall-in to the shared block is exactly a case label with no break. */
