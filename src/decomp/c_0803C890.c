/* Fire every gUnknown_0849EDB0 row's unk0c callback with a 1, skipping the
 * rows whose unk04 is 0xffff or above. Two different sentinels on the same
 * field: -1 ends the list (signed `cmp` against a materialised -1) and 0xffff
 * is a "no entry" marker inside it, tested UNSIGNED (`ldr r0,=0xfffe;
 * cmp r1,r0; bhi`), which is why the cast sits on the compare and not on the
 * field -- unk04 is `int` at every other reader.
 *
 * `i` is a u8 -- the `lsl #0x18; lsr #0x18` on the increment -- so the row
 * offset `i * 0x18` is recomputed from scratch each iteration instead of
 * becoming a giv. Same loop as sub_0803C670's last one, which has no gate and
 * therefore one spare register, and so hoists `base + 0x10` where this one
 * does not. */
