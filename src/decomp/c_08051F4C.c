/* Promoted from assembly; each function below is byte-for-byte
 * identical to the original. Order is address order and must
 * stay that way -- the linker places this file's .text as one
 * contiguous block at 0x08051F4C.
 * sub_08051F4C @ 0x08051F4C
 */

/* MATCHED. Not part of the sub_08051DE0 cluster -- a fresh function in the
 * same neighbourhood that reuses its type vocabulary. It installs a unit's
 * sprite for one side/slot pair: reset the two per-side scratch words, publish
 * the side and slot into gUnknown_0300453C / gUnknown_0300451C, allocate the
 * sprite through sub_08015410 and stash its id, then set five of its
 * attributes and decide which follow-up runs.
 *
 * Three spellings had to be found:
 *
 *  - The FIFTH argument of sub_08015410 is its own statement (`f`). Inline, the
 *    whole `gUnknown_08552178[a][b] * 7 + 6` expression is evaluated after the
 *    other four arguments and needs an extra `ip` shuffle; the ROM computes it
 *    before the two pool words and only narrows it to u8 at the call, which is
 *    what a plain local produces. `int f`, not `u16` -- a u8-narrowing local
 *    would move the `lsls #0x18; lsrs #0x18` up to the assignment.
 *
 *  - `row` is load-bearing. `gUnknown_085D6A48[w][2]` folds the constant 4
 *    into the symbol's address (`adds r2,#4`) where the ROM wants it in the
 *    `ldrh` immediate; binding the row to a `u16 *` and subscripting that
 *    gives `ldrh [r0,#4]`. Same rule as the struct-vs-array choice on
 *    gUnknown_08552D80 in sub_08051DE0, reached from the other direction --
 *    here the shared declaration is an array and the local supplies the
 *    aggregate.
 *
 *  - `c` and `d` are real variables, not a spelling artefact. The parameters
 *    live in r7/sb for the body and the copies live in [sp,#4]/sl purely so
 *    the LAST sub_08051D74 call can use them; `sub_08051D74(a, b)` there
 *    coalesces the copies away and loses two instructions. Same
 *    two-variables-two-registers rule as sub_0800C124 in
 *    docs/agbcc-codegen.md.
 *
 * `entries[b].unk00 = 1` is measured, and its sibling sub_08051BEC needs
 * `= unk01` for the identical-looking statement -- see the note there. */
