 * address, but the mask spelling costs a pool word for 0xfffe and an `ands`,
 * where the ROM has `lsrs r1, #0x11; lsls r1, #1` -- the u16 parameter's
 * entry narrowing (`>> 16`) merged with the `>> 1`, then the pointer scale
 * back up. That merge is only available when the halving is written as
 * arithmetic on a `u16 *`. The promoted ApplyPaletteExt next door does use the
 * mask form, but its `b` is `u32`, so it has no entry shift to merge with --
 * the two spellings are not interchangeable between them.
 *
 * The third parameter is u16 (entry `lsls #0x10; lsrs #0x10`), which is why
 * unknown-functions.h was corrected from the `int` this wave first guessed;
 * sub_08037790, its only caller, passes a literal and was re-verified. */
