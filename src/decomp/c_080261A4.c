/* A 2-D table lookup: the row is `sub_08042DE0(a1) - 1` scaled by `muls #0x32`
 * (0x32 BYTES, i.e. 0x19 halfwords) and the column is a2 scaled by `lsls #1`.
 * gUnknown_08499608 is declared as `u16 [][0x19]` in wave 29 so both scales
 * come out of the type; hand-rolled arithmetic on a flat array would put the
 * row multiply in the wrong place.
 *
 * The result is shifted left by 2 and sub_08002844 masks it with 0x3ff, so the
 * entries are tile indices. `pop {r4}; pop {r1}` is the value-returning
 * epilogue and both parameters arrive bare, hence `int` for both. */
