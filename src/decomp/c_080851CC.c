 * The parameter is a raw `s16 *`, the same vocabulary the matched neighbour
 * src/decomp/c_080859E0.c uses (`void sub_080859E0(u16 *p) { p[0x32] = 0; }`).
 * A struct tag was deliberately NOT invented: +0x66 is read twice with two
 * different widths -- `ldrb [r4]` for sub_080266DC's u8 parameter and
 * `movs r0,#0; ldrsh r2,[r4,r0]` for sub_080436DC's int one -- and both are the
 * one s16 element `p[0x33]`, the ldrb being the prototype's narrowing folded
 * into the load. `adds r4, #0x66` is computed once and shared because THUMB has
 * no ldrsh immediate form and 0x66 is past ldrb's imm5 limit.
 *
 * sub_080853B0 is nullary (it never reads r0), so the proc pointer still
 * sitting in r0 at that `bl` is not argument setup. */
