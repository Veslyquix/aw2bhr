/* MATCHED wave 34, W34-E.
 *
 * Fills in the map/unit cursor pane's proc and hands it to sub_08087104,
 * choosing between the gUnknown_03005900/30 pair and the
 * gUnknown_03005990[gUnknown_0300596C]/80 pair on `gUnknown_081D940C->unk01
 * == 2`. That choice is already described from the other side on the
 * gUnknown_03005900 note in unknown-globals.h; struct Unk081D940C was added
 * there for this function.
 *
 * The whole cost of this one was two statements at the top, and they are an
 * instance of the three-local rule recorded in docs/agbcc-codegen.md (W34-E):
 *
 *   ldr  r1, =gUnknown_081D940C   <- forced by reading ->unk01
 *   ldr  r0, [r1]
 *   ldrb r0, [r0, #1]             <- kind = gUnknown_081D940C->unk01;
 *   adds r5, r1, #0               <- pp   = &gUnknown_081D940C;
 *
 * `kind` and `pp` are two pseudos joined by a copy, and the ORDER of the two
 * statements is what puts the copy after the `ldrb` rather than before it.
 * Measured on the way here, all size-exact:
 *   - naming the global at both sites and binding nothing: agbcc parks the
 *     address in this unit's .rodata (a `.LC` word) and reaches it through a
 *     second `ldr` at each site, +4 bytes.
 *   - `pp = &g;` alone, before or after the unk48 store: 85.7%, ONE pseudo
 *     loaded straight into r5, no copy.
 *   - `st = *pp;` as the intermediate: 85.7%, agbcc folds `st` away.
 *   - `st = g; pp = &g;`: 96.4% -- the copy appears but lands BEFORE the
 *     `ldrb`, because binding the pointer rather than the byte leaves the
 *     address dead one instruction too early.
 *
 * The second read after the call must stay `(*pp)->unk01`; spelling it as the
 * global again brings the `.LC` straight back. */
