/* One shape instantiated twice with sub_0808488C: sub_08084858(i) selects
 * between a per-index 32-byte record and one fixed record. Two things in here
 * are not free:
 *   - The `!= 0` with an explicit `else` is load-bearing. `if (x == 0) return
 *     <array>; return <fixed>;` compiles with the arms SWAPPED (`beq` to the
 *     array, fixed falling through) and does not match; the ROM branches away
 *     on non-zero and falls through into the array arm.
 *   - The pointer arithmetic must be written on a flat array, not as
 *     gUnknown_0823DC38[i] on a `u8 [][32]`. Both spell the same address here,
 *     but the sibling's `+ 6` only survives in the flat form -- see the
 *     comment on the global and docs/agbcc-codegen.md, wave 20 (W20-B). */

/* sub_08084864's shape with the index biased by 6 and the other fixed record.
 * The bias must stay INSIDE the address expression on a flat array: as
 * `gUnknown_0823DC38[i + 6]` on a `u8 [][32]` fold distributes the element-size
 * multiply and folds 6 * 32 into the symbol, so the ROM's runtime
 * `adds r0, r4, #6` disappears; and hoisting it into its own statement
 * (`j = i + 6;`) emits that add BEFORE the pool `ldr` instead of after it. */
