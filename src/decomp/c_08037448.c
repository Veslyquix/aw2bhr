 */

/* Collects every gUnknown_085C77A0 row whose unk1a equals the requested id and
 * that sub_080373F0 accepts, into gUnknown_02027F78, then arms the
 * gUnknown_02027F74 cursor pair over the result. Returns whether anything was
 * found.
 *
 * The comparison is written `gUnknown_085C77A0[i].unk1a == a1` with a1 a plain
 * `u8` parameter -- NOT via a `u16` local. agbcc narrows the compare to the
 * member's HImode and re-extends the u8 side, and LICM hoists the invariant
 * half, which is the ROM's `lsls r6, r6, #0x10` in the preheader against
 * `lsrs r0, r6, #0x10` in the body. A `u16` local instead makes the conversion
 * free, costs a second pseudo and loses both shifts.
 *
 * The `count > 0x31` bail sits AFTER the body and BEFORE the `i` increment, so
 * it is a `break` at the end of the loop body rather than part of the `for`
 * condition. */
