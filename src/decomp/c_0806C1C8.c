 *
 * `lsrs #1; lsls #1` is not a mask clearing bit 0: counted as
 * `(u32)x >> 1 << 1` it is the /2 fused with the u16 array's own scale, i.e.
 * the byte offset of element x/2. The `(u32)` cast is load-bearing --
 * gUnknown_03004008 is `s32` and without it the divide is `asrs`.
 *
 * The literal pool is ordered (gUnknown_081A3D84, gUnknown_03004008, gPal), and
 * because agbcc's expand_assignment computes the DESTINATION address first, the
 * one-statement spelling emits gPal FIRST. Binding the table base moves that
 * reference into an earlier statement (sub_0806E7FC's fix, which lands gPal in
 * the middle); binding the INDEX as well pushes gPal to last AND moves the
 * `lsrs` ahead of gPal's pool load, which is the only arrangement that
 * reproduces this function. Both locals are required; either one alone is a
 * near miss of one instruction's position. */
