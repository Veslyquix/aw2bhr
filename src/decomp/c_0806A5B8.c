/* One step of the RED-ONLY fade, and a strict subset of sub_080139E0
 * (src/decomp/c_080137AC.c): for every armed row it advances ONLY channel 0 by
 * the row's delta and clamps it, then repacks all three channels into gPal.
 * Channels 1 and 2 are read raw and never accumulated, which is what makes the
 * pack drift towards red rather than towards white.
 *
 * The `(s8)` casts are load-bearing for the same reason c_080137AC.c records:
 * gUnknown_0200B614 is u8, the `+=` overflows past 0x7f, and reading the sum
 * back as SIGNED is what turns the overflow into a negative the `< 0` arm
 * saturates. The ROM distinguishes the two reads of channel 0 -- `ldrb` for the
 * accumulate (only the low byte reaches the `strb`) and `ldrsb` for the clamp.
 *
 * `g` and `b` are int, NOT the s16 that sub_080139E0 uses: they carry no clamp,
 * so nothing narrows them, and the ROM shows no `lsl #0x10 / asr #0x10` pair on
 * either. They must still be LOCALS rather than subexpressions of the store --
 * that is what puts both `ldrsb`s ahead of the two `- 0x20`s, and it is also
 * what hands gPal the callee-saved register: written inline, gUnknown_0200B5F4's
 * address pseudo is created first and wins sl instead, moving the pool word
 * order with it. */
