 * The case ORDER is the source's, not the table's -- agbcc lays case bodies out
 * in source order and the ROM has 39/40 before 37/38, and 44 between 3 and 4.
 * The jump table itself runs 3..45 with 28 default entries in the middle, which
 * is what fixes the `subs r0, #3; cmp r0, #0x2a` bound.
 *
 * `a == b` on two u16 parameters compiles to a compare of the two `<< 16`
 * forms with `b` recovered by `lsrs #0x10` -- the shared-shift pattern, not a
 * sign of anything in the source. */
