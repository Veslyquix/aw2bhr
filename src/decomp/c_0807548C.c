 *
 * THE FIRST TWO PARAMETERS ARE s16, not the `int` the header used to declare.
 * With `int` the subtract happens in SImode before the narrowing (`subs #16;
 * lsls #0x10; lsrs #0x10`) and needs no pool word; only a 16-bit parameter lets
 * combine fold the subtract into the SHIFTED domain, giving the ROM's `lsls
 * #0x10; adds <0xFFF00000>; lsrs #0x10` -- and that is also what makes both
 * parameters share the single 0xFFF00000 pool word. u16 is wrong for a
 * different reason: it hoists both `lsls` above the pool load.
 *
 * The locals are s16 carrying an EXPLICIT (u16) truncation, and the two halves
 * of that are separately load-bearing. The (u16) is why the narrowing is `lsrs`
 * and not `asrs`; the s16 declaration is why `-x` re-widens with `lsls #0x10;
 * asrs #0x10` before the `rsbs` instead of collapsing to a bare `negs`. Written
 * with u16 locals and `-(s16)x` at the use, agbcc knows the pseudo is already
 * 16-bit and drops the extension -- 8 bytes across the two coordinates.
 *
 * +0x2e and +0x30 are u16 HERE, where the promoted c_08075368.c calls them s16:
 * this function reads them straight back for sub_08072C40's u16 parameters and
 * the ROM uses plain `ldrh`, which an s16 field cannot produce. The paired
 * stores are chained assignments -- `p->unk2a = p->unk2e = v` evaluates the
 * inner one first, which is what puts +0x2e ahead of +0x2a.
 *
 * The blend tail is c_0806BB08.c's verbatim with 0xC for its 9: two `.raw`
 * read-modify-writes that agbcc folds into ONE `ldrh`/`strh` pair because the
 * shadow is not volatile. */
