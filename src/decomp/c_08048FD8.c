/* Wave 43, W43-L. MATCHED (228/228; the one reloc difference is the pool word
 * spelled against a different symbol, resolving to the same address).
 *
 * NEEDS ITS POOL WORD PLACED. The data/promoted.json entry must carry
 *   "rodata": ["0x0812A158"]
 * then re-run tools/split_rodata.py and tools/gen_lds.py. The word holds
 * &gUnknown_084C30F8, exactly as sub_08048850's 0x0812A144 does.
 *
 * Picks the next script to run. unk839 starts as gUnknown_0200C420.unk0f; if
 * that is above 1 it either forces 2 (when unk836 is clear) or walks the
 * sixteen predicates at gUnknown_084C24A4[3..0x12], compacts the passing
 * indices into unk83d, and picks one of them at random.
 *
 * `n` deliberately does double duty -- it is both the compaction counter and
 * the "something was chosen" flag. It is 1 on entry and is only reset to 0 on
 * the path that recomputes it, which is why the tail's `if (n != 0)` guard
 * reads a variable that otherwise looks like a pure count. Do not split it
 * into two locals; the ROM keeps one register (r5) live across both roles.
 *
 * `(u32)gUnknown_03004008` is required, not cosmetic: the global is declared
 * s32 but the ROM calls __umodsi3, and unknown-globals.h already records other
 * readers treating it unsigned.
 *
 * The store and the increment are SEPARATE statements, and that was the whole
 * of attempt 1's +4 bytes. `unk83d[n++] = i` binds the old n to its own temp
 * and increments BEFORE computing the address; splitting them lets agbcc
 * compute the address with n, store, and only then narrow n + 1, which is the
 * ROM's order.
 *
 * gUnknown_084C24A0 and gUnknown_084C24A4 are two declared views of ONE
 * 8-byte-stride ROM table -- see the note in unknown-globals.h for why both
 * exist and why a single struct array at ...A0 would relocate the second use
 * wrongly. */
