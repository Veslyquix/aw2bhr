/* Promoted from assembly; each function below is byte-for-byte
 * identical to the original. Order is address order and must
 * stay that way -- the linker places this file's .text as one
 * contiguous block at 0x0802F28C.
 * sub_0802F28C @ 0x0802F28C
 */

/* A bulk reset of the link block. Three short byte clears over the head of
 * gUnknown_02025564, then the twelve 0x1c-byte records at +0x20, then four
 * 13-byte rows of gUnknown_020257E4.
 *
 * TWO COUNTERS, and that is the whole register allocation. The three short
 * loops and both inner loops use `j`; only the two outer loops use `i`. One
 * shared counter puts the outer index in r3 where the ROM has r4 and swaps
 * r2/r3 in all three short loops -- 36 bytes of difference from one variable.
 *
 * The +0x22..+0x32 and +0x34..+0x38 runs really are DESCENDING (`strb` then
 * `subs r0,#1` on the pointer). The last loop is the opposite case: its pointer
 * ASCENDS while the counter counts down, which is check_dbra_loop rewriting an
 * ordinary `j <= 0xc` and not a descending source loop.
 *
 * The dead `ldrb` in front of the short loops' and the last loop's stores is
 * the volatile tell; the record array at +0x20 carries none and is not
 * volatile. See the type comments in include/unknown-globals.h. */
