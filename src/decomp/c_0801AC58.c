/* Commit one save slot's staging buffer back into the live tables.
 *
 * The 0x10-byte stack array preserves bit 4 of every gUnknown_0200CC38.unk20
 * slot across the sub_0801AD70 call, which is free to clobber them, and puts it
 * back afterwards (`& 0xef` clears bit 4, `| tmp[i]` restores it).
 *
 * gUnknown_02002000 is the 0x1000-byte flash staging buffer that
 * src/decomp/c_0801B018.c validates; the header view here is a cast over the
 * same u8 array for the same reason given there -- +0x0e is a u16 destination
 * offset, +0x50 a u16 length and +0x52 the payload. gUnknown_0200CC58 and
 * gUnknown_0200CC48 in asm/ are gUnknown_0200CC38.unk20 and .unk10 with the
 * member offset folded into the address constant by LICM, exactly as the
 * struct's note in include/unknown-globals.h records; likewise
 * gUnknown_02002FEF is BUF->unkfef.
 *
 * gUnknown_0200CC2C is re-read on every iteration of the copy loop because the
 * `strb` through it may alias it -- no volatile is needed for that.
 *
 * ONE local `j` for the sub_0801AD70 result AND every inner loop counter, and
 * that is measured. Split into a separate `r`, j's live range is short enough
 * that it outranks the -fforce-addr base pointers and takes r2, pushing the
 * bases to r3; the ROM has it the other way round in all three inner loops and
 * in the sub_0801AD70 result, which only happens when they are one pseudo whose
 * live range spans the function. */
