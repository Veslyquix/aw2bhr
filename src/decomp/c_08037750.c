/* The `(u16)` cast on the palette offset is load-bearing and not cosmetic:
 * ApplyPaletteExt's second parameter is declared `u32`, so `a * 0x20` alone
 * emits a bare `lsl #5`. The ROM has `lsl #0x15; lsr #0x10`, which is that
 * shift merged with a 16-bit truncation. Either the cast is in the source or
 * the prototype's second parameter is really `u16`; the cast is chosen because
 * it is local to this call site and ApplyPaletteExt has matched callers
 * elsewhere that the prototype change would disturb. */
