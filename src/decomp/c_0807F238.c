 * (already matched) -- same statement run, different constants.
 *
 * NO zero is live anywhere in this function (the coefficients are stored 8/8
 * and BLDY is a volatile SELF-STORE, not a `= 0`), so the union `.raw` view is
 * byte-exact here and the `*(u16 *)&` cast is not needed -- the control case in
 * the blend-shadow section of docs/agbcc-codegen.md. Probed: the two spellings
 * are identical in this function.
 *
 * `gUnknown_03002020 = 8; gUnknown_03002B28 = 8;` needs no `v = ` chaining --
 * probed against the c_08037260.c spelling and both emit the same single
 * `movs r1,#8` feeding both stores.
 *
 * `gUnknown_03001FFC = gUnknown_03001FFC;` is real source: only a volatile
 * lvalue emits the bare `ldrh`/`strh` pair to the same address. */
