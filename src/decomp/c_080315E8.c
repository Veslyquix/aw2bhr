 * THE RESULT IS AN `int` LOCAL, not the u16 parameter returned directly. With
 * `return b;` gcc keeps a second pseudo for the return value (an extra
 * `adds r6,r5,#0` and an extra pushed register) AND fully narrows `a` for the
 * compare; with the int local it narrows only `b`, and the comparison stays on
 * the two left-shifted parameters -- `cmp r0, r1` with neither `lsrs`, which is
 * shorten_compare on an equality test and is exactly what the ROM has. */
