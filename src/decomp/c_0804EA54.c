/* Queues one unit sprite's tile data into OBJ VRAM. FIVE BOUND LOCALS, and
 * every one of them is load-bearing -- this is the wave-32 worked example of
 * "binding locals are punctuation".
 *
 *   t    forces gUnknown_03004580 to the FRONT of the literal pool. Inline, the
 *        whole destination expression is evaluated after the source and the
 *        pool comes out reversed.
 *   o1   the source's byte offset. Second, because the ROM computes it before
 *        the destination even though it belongs to the first argument.
 *   o2   the destination's tile offset -- WITHOUT the 0x06010000, which the ROM
 *        adds last of all, after the source is finished. That split is why o2
 *        is a local and the VRAM base is not.
 *   k    the tile-source index. Bound, the inner subscript is evaluated before
 *        gUnknown_02029BA8's own pool word is loaded; inline, agbcc loads that
 *        base first and holds it across the whole chain, which costs a second
 *        high register.
 *   row  gives the gUnknown_085D6A48 ROW ADDRESS a second use, so [9] stays a
 *        `ldrh [rN, #0x12]` displacement instead of being folded into the base
 *        (`adds rN, #0x12`). Two bytes. Same lever as the `e1 = &pos[k]`
 *        binding in c_0804EEFC.c.
 *
 * The two shift pairs are MULTIPLIES, per docs/agbcc-codegen.md: `c * 0x480` is
 * `lsls #3; adds; lsls #0x17; lsrs #0x10` (times nine, then times 0x80, then
 * truncated to u16) and `x * 0x20` is `lsls #0x15; lsrs #0x10`. Written as
 * shifts they cost an instruction each. */
