 * form of the byte-view store), EVA/EVB zeroed and BLDY ramped by
 * Interpolate. The duration lives at +0x64 as a SIGNED halfword -- the
 * `movs r1,#0; ldrsh r0,[r6,r1]` is THUMB's only sign-extending load form,
 * and proc+0x64 stays in a callee-saved register because it is read three
 * times. A zero duration breaks the proc immediately.
 *
 * The counter bump is INSIDE the assignment, not a statement before it:
 * gUnknown_03001FFC's address pseudo is created at the head of the
 * statement that stores to it, so the ROM's `ldr r4,=gUnknown_03001FFC`
 * sits ahead of the `ldr/adds/str` of proc->unk54. Written as a separate
 * `proc->unk54++;` statement the ldr lands after the bump -- 8 bytes,
 * same instruction count. */
