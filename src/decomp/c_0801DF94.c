/* Drains the sprite-request ring: pops entries with sub_0801A700 until it
 * returns 0, dispatches each on the top two bits of the entry's tagged unk04
 * pointer, then advances the OAM cursor by the u16 the pointer addresses.
 *
 * The dispatch is agbcc's balanced switch tree, not a chain of `if`s -- it
 * tests the MIDDLE case (0) first and `bgt` splits the remaining two, exactly
 * as the matched sub_0801E3B4 does. That forces the switch value to be SIGNED,
 * which is why the mask is spelled `~0x3FFFFFFF` and the third label
 * `~0x7FFFFFFF`: 0xC0000000 and 0x80000000 are `unsigned int` in C89 and would
 * give an unsigned tree (`bhi`).
 *
 * The `(s16)` casts on unk00/unk02/unk08 are the ROM's `ldrsh` at an `int`
 * parameter -- see the note on struct Unk0200ED20 in include/unknown-globals.h,
 * which argues those members are really s16 and the casts should then go away.
 *
 * The two `sub_0801A700` calls are the source's, not loop rotation: the twin
 * sub_0801EE10 writes the single-call form `while ((e = f()) != 0)` and gets
 * ONE `bl` reached by a `b` to the bottom test. */
