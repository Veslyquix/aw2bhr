/* MATCHED, wave 56 (W56-E).  Draws the seven-slot menu: one row per non-empty
 * gUnknown_02023830 record, each row a name string, a cost and a window fill.
 *
 * promote.json needs "rodata": ["0x08090C10", "0x08090C14"] -- those two ROM
 * words are agbcc's own -fforce-addr address constants for gUnknown_02023830
 * and gUnknown_030033EC.  BOTH symbols are ALSO reached in this same function
 * through ordinary inline pool words, so one function shows both spellings of
 * the same global; that is -fforce-addr choosing per reference, not two
 * different objects.  The honest spelling (name the real global, never the
 * 0x08090Cxx slot) is what produced this match.
 *
 * gUnknown_08610A38 is NOT a pool slot -- a scaled index is added before the
 * load, so it is a genuine array base and is referenced normally.
 *
 * Three readings that each cost an attempt:
 *
 *  - `v` is u16, not int.  It reaches sub_0802239C's u16 fifth parameter, and
 *    an int local spills SHIFTED (`lsls #16; str` / `ldr; lsrs #16`) where the
 *    ROM stores and reloads the value straight.  +4 bytes.
 *
 *  - The `+1` byte of the record must fold into the load DISPLACEMENT.
 *    `gUnknown_02023830[idx * 4 + 1]` does not: fold reassociates it to
 *    `(idx * 4 + 1) + base` and emits `adds r0, #1` with `ldrb [r0, #0]`.
 *    Binding the element address to a pointer for that one statement gives
 *    the ROM's `ldrb [r0, #1]`.
 *
 *  - Do NOT reach the record through a locally-declared struct cast on the
 *    `u8 *` base (the gUnknown_08499590 idiom).  It is correct addressing but
 *    it CSEs the base into ONE loop-invariant pseudo, which then takes sl and
 *    evicts `flag` to a fresh stack slot: +4 frame, +4 bytes, one extra pool
 *    word.  The ROM rematerialises `ldr rN, =gUnknown_02023830` at each of the
 *    four uses, which is what plain array subscripting emits.
 *
 * `i < 7` is the unsigned `cmp #6; bhi` at the loop bottom, and it is written
 * FIRST in the `&&` because the ROM tests it before re-reading the record. */
