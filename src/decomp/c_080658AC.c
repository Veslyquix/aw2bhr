/* The inverse of sub_08065818 (src/decomp/c_08065818.c): that function packs the
 * header at +0x00 into the seven bytes at +0x84, this one unpacks them back.
 *
 * Two shapes here are NOT the `?:` the exemplar uses, and the ROM says so
 * directly. sub_08065818's `unk03 ? unk03 - 4 : 0` lays the NON-zero arm first
 * with the `b` to the tail; both stores here lay the ZERO arm first. `?:` folds
 * to the exemplar's order whichever way the condition is spelled (probed both),
 * so the zero-arm-first order is an if/else STATEMENT, and the +0x07 one keeps
 * two separate `strb` because the arms end up in different registers.
 *
 * `(u8)(unk88 - 1)` rather than `unk88 - 1`: the cast is what puts the constant
 * on the unk88 side as `adds #0xff` (shorten_binary_op narrows the add to
 * QImode). Written `unk88 - 1 + unk15` fold reassociates it to
 * `unk88 + (unk15 - 1)` and the `#0xff` lands on the freshly loaded unk15
 * instead -- same size, wrong two instructions. */
