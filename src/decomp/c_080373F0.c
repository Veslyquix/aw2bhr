/* Returns 0 when `a1` fails the current mode's check: with byte 0x32 of
 * gUnknown_03003FC0 set, when sub_0802490C(a1) differs from a2; otherwise
 * when a1 is in 0xB7..0xBF, or when byte 1 is 3 and sub_0803CC64(a1) is 0.
 *
 * The three failure exits are one `return 0` reached by goto. Written as
 * three `return 0`s, cross-jumping keeps the last copy, but the ROM's
 * surviving block is the middle one (after the range test), so the label sits
 * there. `goto ok` on equality gives the ROM's `beq ok; b fail` pair. */
