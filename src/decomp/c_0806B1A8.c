 * PROMOTION NEEDS A .rodata POOL WORD PLACED:
 *   "rodata": ["0x0816E170"]
 * then re-run tools/split_rodata.py and tools/gen_lds.py.
 *
 * Four things in here are not what they look like:
 *
 *  - `gUnknown_0816E170` is NOT a global. The ROM word at 0x0816E170 is
 *    0x08499578, i.e. agbcc's own -fforce-addr address constant for
 *    gUnknown_08499578, which this function reads twice (CpuFastSet and
 *    sub_08014668). Naming the global directly is what reproduces the
 *    `ldr rN,<pool>; ldr rM,[rN]; ldr rK,[rM]` double indirection. Note this
 *    is TWO uses, not four -- the "it needs four uses to hold" line in
 *    docs/agbcc-codegen.md does not apply to a word the ROM already carries.
 *
 *  - `x * 0x421` is wrong for the grey ramp -- see c_08066EBC.c and
 *    c_0806DF20.c. It must be `(x << 10) + (x << 5) + x`, and the second ramp
 *    entry is the proof: its two shifted terms strength-reduce into two
 *    separate givs (step 0x400 and step 0x20) with `0x10 + i` left as a plain
 *    add, where a MULT_EXPR would give ONE giv stepping 0x421.
 *
 *  - The 0x2280 bias must NOT be bound to a local. Reading
 *    gUnknown_08581984[i & 0x1f] TWICE in the source is what stops loop.c
 *    hoisting the `movs #0x8a; lsls #6` constant into the preheader; with a
 *    `t` local holding the element, the constant becomes a movable, is
 *    hoisted, and costs a register plus two bytes. Wave-49 W49-A ("NOT binding
 *    a VALUE to a local is a lever") -- and it was NOT register pressure, r7
 *    is free in the ROM throughout this loop.
 *
 *  - gUnknown_030030E0's two BLEND target groups are written through `.raw`
 *    with group masks, not field by field. `.bits.effect = 1` is a BYTE
 *    read-modify-write and a QImode store cannot be forwarded into the HImode
 *    load that follows, which is exactly why the ROM commits the effect byte
 *    and then re-`ldrh`s. Ten individual `.bits.targetN_enable_*` writes merge
 *    the effect RMW into the byte-0 group instead and lose the `ldrh`/`strh`
 *    pair -- the group masks 0xFFE0 and 0xE0FF are the tell, since five 1-bit
 *    field writes give five separate `mov #N; neg; and` steps.
