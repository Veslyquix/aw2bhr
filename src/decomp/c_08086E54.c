/* Swaps between two proc scripts according to the byte at index `a1` of the
 * candidate list four bytes into gUnknown_02027F74.
 *
 * The address arithmetic is src/decomp/c_08086D98.c's idiom and for the same
 * reason: `(u8 *)&gUnknown_02027F74` bumped by 4 in a statement of its own
 * keeps the `adds r0, #4` at runtime, where gUnknown_02027F78 (the ROM's own
 * name for that address) or a member array would fold it into the pool word.
 *
 * `(u8)sub_0803CA54(...)` is the caller's own narrowing -- src/decomp is
 * promoted with an `int` return, and include/unknown-functions.h records why
 * the `lsls #0x18` belongs here. No argument setup appears because the byte is
 * already in r0 from the `ldrb` that the `<= 0xb3` test just read.
 *
 * The `else if` re-tests the byte rather than reusing the first comparison, and
 * the ROM's opening `bhi` jumps straight into that arm -- jump threading, since
 * a byte above 0xb3 fails the `&&` and satisfies the `else if` unconditionally.
 * That duplicated test is the shape; a plain `else` emits one branch fewer. */

/* Fills the first ten entries of each of the first eight 32-halfword rows of

 * two window-size globals sub_08086DF4 reads out of gUnknown_03003F68 and
 * flushes.
 *
 * Two readings the assembly forces:
 *   - The stored value is `(n + 0x200) | 0x6000`, not `n + 0x6200`. Both
 *     constants are LICM-hoisted into their own registers (r7 = 0x200 via
 *     `movs #0x80; lsls #2`, r6 = 0x6000 via `movs #0xc0; lsls #7`) and the ROM
 *     spends an `adds` AND an `orrs`; the single-constant spelling folds them
 *     into one `adds` against one hoisted word. 0x6000 is the palette bits.
 *   - `n` is a running counter of its own, not `i * 10 + j`. It is bumped once
 *     per inner trip with no reset and no per-row init in the inner preheader,
 *     which is what the giv for `i * 10 + j` would have to place there.
 * The pointer global is re-read inside the inner loop (`mov r0, ip; ldr r1,
 * [r0]`) because it is named directly and is not const -- the same tell
 * src/decomp/c_080858C0.c documents. */
