 *
 * Four bitfield writes come out as TWO read-modify-writes because agbcc merges
 * consecutive stores that land in the same byte, and the merge preserves source
 * order inside each byte -- which is how the operand order is recoverable at
 * all. Byte 0 gets `|0x40` (effect) then `|4` (target1 BG2); byte 1 gets
 * `|0x10` (target2 OBJ) then `|8` (target2 BG3), so OBJ is written BEFORE BG3
 * in the source even though its bit is higher. Writing them the other way round
 * swaps the two `movs`. */
