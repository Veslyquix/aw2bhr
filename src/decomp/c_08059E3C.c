/* Collects every cell the current army may act on into the caller's array and
 * terminates it with v = 0xFFFF.  A cell survives four filters: the movement
 * map value must be non-negative, the terrain must be flagged in
 * gUnknown_085767D5, its owner bits must equal gUnknown_03004084, and the
 * +0x376A plane must be non-zero.
 *
 * FOUND BY THE PERMUTER (wave 61), seeded from the wave-77 draft that had got
 * to 4 differing bytes.  TWO ODDITIES BELOW ARE LOAD-BEARING -- each was
 * removed and the match re-checked with trymatch, and each removal lost it:
 *
 *   1. `zero` and the `+= zero` ARE A NO-OP and exist only to shape codegen.
 *      Deleting the pair loses the match.  The earlier draft carried the same
 *      trick as `gUnknown_03003340[y][x] += 0;` at the TOP of the inner loop;
 *      what the permuter changed is that it now sits INSIDE the filters, so it
 *      runs only for surviving cells.  Adding zero is a no-op either way, so
 *      the two spellings are equivalent in behaviour and differ only in the
 *      register allocation they produce.
 *
 *   2. The bare block around the four stores has to stay a block.  It reads as
 *      redundant braces; flattening it loses the match.
