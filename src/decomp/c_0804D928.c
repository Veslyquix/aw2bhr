/* Rebuilds the OBJ attributes of the sprite belonging to the current

 *
 * Twin of sub_0804E3B4, which differs only in the tile base (0xc0 vs 0x60) and
 * the continuation symbol. See "Large functions" in docs/agbcc-codegen.md for
 * the three source spellings this function turns on:
 *   - `pal = tbl[...]; oam.paletteNum = pal;` -- a bitfield store narrows a
 *     table `ldrh` to `ldrb` unless the loaded value is bound to a local first.
 *   - `* 0x100` and not `<< 8` -- the multiply is shortened to HImode by the C
 *     front end, so it keeps a real memory operand and is not CSEd against the
 *     value loaded for the hFlip statement two statements earlier.
 *   - the priority index reads BOTH globals directly; binding either one to a
 *     local lets combine drop the `lsl #16; lsr #16` zero-extension.
