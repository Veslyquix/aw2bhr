/* Clears the five army records and stamps each one's identity: unk2a gets the
 * slot index inside the loop, and unk2b gets that slot's single mask bit
 * (1, 2, 4, 8 for slots 1..4) in four statements afterwards. Slot 0 is reset
 * like the rest but gets no bit.
 *
 * `i` is an `int` -- the exit test is `cmp r4, #4; ble`, SIGNED, and the value
 * is stored into the u8 unk2a with no narrowing at all.
 *
 * The array pointer is reloaded before nearly every store because each store
 * may alias it; where consecutive fields DO share one `ldr` (unk00/unk04/
 * unk11, the unk14..unk1a run, unk20/unk24, unk26/unk28/unk2a) that is agbcc's
 * own CSE and not a different source spelling -- one plain assignment
 * statement per field reproduces the grouping exactly.
 *
 * gUnknown_08090A8C is the -fforce-addr word holding &gPlayers, which
 * is why the chain is three `ldr`s deep. Named honestly; the build places the
 * word. */
