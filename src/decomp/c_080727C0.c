/* Blits tile `idx` of a w-by-h tile sheet into a 32-wide BG tilemap at
 * (x, y), adding `base` to every entry and clipping to the 32x32 screen
 * block; the sheet is packed 0x20/w tiles per row.
 *
 * `p` has to be a separate local seeded from `src` rather than a reassignment
 * of the parameter. agbcc emits parameter copies (and then, separately, the
 * promoted-mode conversions like the `u16 base` narrowing) ahead of the
 * function body, so a stack parameter that is only READ once stays in memory
 * and its `ldr` lands where the body uses it -- after the base conversion,
 * which is exactly where the ROM has it. Reassigning `src` makes it a
 * parameter copy instead, moving the `ldr` up two instructions and letting
 * the accumulation happen in a low register, which is 4 bytes short. */

/* Same blit as sub_080727C0 but vertically mirrored, and the sheet's real row
 * stride comes from a two-byte header: src[0] + 1 halfwords, pixel data from
 * src + 2. See sub_080727C0 for why `p` is a separate local seeded from the
 * parameter rather than a reassignment of it.
 *
 * The two odd-looking constructs are the whole difference between 97.3% and a
 * match, and both were found by decomp-permuter after the hand version had
 * the right size and the right instructions in the right order:
 *  - the `do { } while (0)` around the pointer bump and the two divisions.
 *    Without it `x` and `stride` swap the callee-saved r9/sl pair: `stride`
 *    has to win r9, which means it has to outrank `x` on
 *    n_refs/live_length, and the block shortens its live range enough to do
 *    that.
 *  - binding `h - iy` to its own local inside the `if`. Inline,
 *    `(h - iy - 1) * stride` is folded before the multiply; bound, the
 *    subtraction of 1 stays on the near side of it, which is the ROM's
 *    `subs r0, r1, r5; subs r0, #1; muls r2, r0`. */
