/* F087 -- three members that differ only in one size constant. The whole
 * function is one call to sub_08011E54(src, dest, size) with size 0x800.
 *
 * Both `lsls #N; lsrs #0x10` pairs are a MULTIPLY that agbcc shortened to
 * HImode, not a shift and not a mask: `shorten_binary_op` applies to
 * MULT_EXPR, so `(u16)(x * 0x800)` becomes `lsl #27; lsr #0x10` in two
 * instructions while `(u16)(x << 11)` would need three (the shift, then the
 * zero-extend pair). That is why the family's `varies` entry is the shift
 * immediate -- 0x19/0x1a/0x1b IS 0x200/0x400/0x800, the same constant that
 * reappears as the size argument.
 *
 * The two products have to be u16 LOCALS and not casts written inline: the
 * locals put both narrowings ahead of the address arithmetic, which is the
 * order the original has. Spelled as casts inside the call the address
 * computation floats up between them and the narrowed parameter needs an
 * `adds r1, r0, #0` copy, one instruction the original does not have.
 *
 * The second parameter is never read -- r1 is written by `lsls r1, r0, #0x1d`
 * before any use -- so it is present in the signature and unused. The
 * destination base is a bare VRAM literal, not a symbol.
