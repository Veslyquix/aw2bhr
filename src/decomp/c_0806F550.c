/* The menu's key handler: B confirms and breaks, Left/Right step unk38 round a

 *
 * unk38 is `s8` and not `u8`: THUMB has no `ldrsb` with an immediate offset, so
 * an s8 field at +0x38 reads as `ldrb` plus `lsls #0x18` -- once with `asrs`
 * for the `> 0x19` compare and the 0x0202F2D8 store, once WITHOUT for the
 * `< 0` sign test, which is exactly what a u8 field could never produce.
 *
 * The `u16 t` local is load-bearing. `gpKeySt->unk02 & 0x20` is narrowed
 * `lsls #0x10; lsrs #0x10` where the neighbouring `& 2` and `& 0x10` tests are
 * not -- that only happens when the value lands in a u16 pseudo. It is also
 * why the wrap store in the Right branch is `strb r2` and not a fresh `movs`:
 * gcc knows t == 0 on that path and reuses the register for the literal 0. */
