 * after it. Masking first, then building the value into a local, then ORing it
 * in, is the only spelling that keeps the ROM's order. The `do { } while (0)`
 * around the group is the same code-motion barrier sub_08067410 needs: without
 * it the final `proc->unk30 = 0` is materialised early, inside the group, and
 * takes a second callee-saved register.
 *
 * `effect = 3` fills the two-bit field, so store_fixed_bit_field sets all_one
