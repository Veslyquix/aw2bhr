 * Same shape as sub_08080D30 minus the trailing gDispIo/SetDispEnable
 * run (data_refs excludes gDispIo here) -- see that function's comment
 * for the shared idiom. Only the constants differ: EVA/EVB are both
 * 0x10 here (vs. 0/0x10), the target1/target2 group bits set are bg2
 * and bg1 instead of bg0 and bg3, and the 03001FE8/030030B4 priority
 * values are swapped (3 then 2, vs. 2 then 3) -- which is why the first
 * gets a bare all-ones orr and the second needs the AND+OR pair.
