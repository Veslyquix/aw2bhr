/* Promoted from assembly; each function below is byte-for-byte
 * identical to the original. Order is address order and must
 * stay that way -- the linker places this file's .text as one
 * contiguous block at 0x08060894.
 * sub_08060894 @ 0x08060894
 */

/* The AI's action-2 roll: it works the running counter up into a percentage of
 * two different denominators, gates on the difficulty table's three byte
 * thresholds, and finally picks action 2 or 1 on a random draw against the
 * caller's percentage.
 *
 * `gUnknown_0816DAD4` in the disassembly is agbcc's -fforce-addr address
 * constant for gUnknown_030046D4 (baserom.gba has 0x030046D4 in that word), so
 * the counter is named directly and the apparent double indirection is that
 * constant plus the volatile read. Every one of the four reads is its own
 * `ldr`, which is the volatile behaviour and not a missing CSE.
 *
 * The final compare is `bhs`, i.e. UNSIGNED, because sub_080129E0 returns `u32`
 * and the usual arithmetic conversions carry that through the `% 100` and into
 * the comparison against the sign-extended `s16` parameter. */
