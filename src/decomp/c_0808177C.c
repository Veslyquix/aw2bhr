/* One of the block's sprite builders, and the closest relative of the
 * sub_080829B0 / sub_08082C0C / sub_08083034 group in src/decomp/c_080824D4.c:
 * the same affine head and the same five-step PutSprite loop, but it owns its
 * own phase counter (+0x4c) rather than taking a step as a parameter, and it
 * ends the proc with Proc_Break when that counter runs past 0xB.
 *
 * The one structural fact worth recording is the SHAPE OF THE HEAD. The ROM has
 * a SINGLE `bl Interpolate` that both arms branch to, with only the argument
 * setup duplicated. That is NOT gcc cross-jumping the two arms of
 *     if (t <= 3) { unk38 = Interpolate(..); SetObjAffine(..); }
 *     else        { unk38 = Interpolate(..); SetObjAffine(..); }
 * the way sub_080829B0's head is -- that spelling was probed here and gcc
 * emitted BOTH affine tails in full (two gSinLut pool words, ~90 extra bytes).
 * The difference is that cross-jumping walks backwards from a jump and stops at
 * the first label, and this affine tail contains two of them (the `unk38 != 0 ?
 * unk38 : 2` branches), so it can never be merged. The head must therefore be
 * written with the SetObjAffine call OUTSIDE the if/else -- only the
 * Interpolate arms differ -- and the merge at the `bl` is then the two-insn
 * cross jump of `bl Interpolate; str r0, [p, #0x38]`.
 * Read backwards: a merge point that lands ON a call, with a tail containing
 * conditional branches, means the tail was written once in the source. */
