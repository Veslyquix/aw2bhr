/* The tracking half of the ~40 sprite setters between 0x0804B180 and
 * 0x08053614: it re-points the proc's own sprite at its
 * gUnknown_02029A10 entry, in coordinates relative to the side's two scroll
 * origins, and does nothing while the side's record is disarmed.
 *
 * THREE BOUND LOCALS AND THE ORDER THEY IMPOSE ARE THE WHOLE PROBLEM HERE.
 * With the two subtractions written inline the ROM's `ldrh` of the entry's `y`
 * and the second scroll pointer both drift past the first subtraction, because
 * agbcc emits each argument's loads at that argument. Naming `y`, `q1` and `q2`
 * in statements of their own puts all three ahead of both subtractions, which
 * is what the ROM does -- and the entry address is CSEd across the `y` and `x`
 * reads, so it survives as one base with #0xa / #8 displacements.
 *
 * unk30/unk34 are `u32` members (wave 26) read `ldrh`: a truncation at the use,
 * not evidence for a halfword member -- the same narrowing agbcc does for
 * gUnknown_0200C528's unk14 in c_08018758.
 *
 * gUnknown_03001FBC is named three times and loaded once (`ldrsh` through the
 * register-offset form), which is CSE and not a local. */

/* The per-frame step of one side's shake/bounce animation. It bumps the
 * record's counter, decides whether the animation is over, then adds this
 * frame's (x, y) offset out of the record's own table into the two scroll
 * origins.
 *
 * THE THREE POINTER LOADS AT THE END ARE BOUND LOCALS, and that is the whole
 * difference between this and a candidate that is otherwise instruction-exact:
 * written inline, agbcc interleaves each `ldr` with the statement that uses it
 * (q1, then the table, then q2 after the first `strh`). The ROM loads all three
 * up front, which is what a statement of its own for each produces.
 *
 * `i = 0` is reached from BOTH sides of the bit0 test -- the `b` out of the
 * then-arm lands on the else-arm's own `movs r6, #0`, which is tail merging,
 * not a shared statement.
 *
 * `d = -d` on a `u16` is `rsbs` followed by `lsls #0x10; lsrs #0x10`: the
 * truncation is part of the assignment, not a separate cast.
 *
 * gUnknown_08136030 in the disassembly is agbcc's own -fforce-addr address
 * constant for gUnknown_02029690 (baserom.gba has 0x02029690 in that word), so
 * the array is named directly and the pool word is placed by the build. */
