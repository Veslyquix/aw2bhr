 * The members do not share a destination class either: sub_080116E8 and
 * sub_0803A174 blit to VRAM through sub_08011C68, sub_0801EFD8 pushes an OAM
 * shadow to 0x07000080 through sub_08011C90 -- a different callee, listed in
 * `varies`. Both destinations are bare address literals in the ROM's pool
 * (`.4byte 0x06017800`, not a relocation), so `(void *)0xNNNNNNNN` is the
 * honest spelling and it is also the one that matches; this is NOT the
 * invented-lds-symbol case in the Workflow section of docs/agbcc-codegen.md,
 * where the pool word would have carried a relocation. */
