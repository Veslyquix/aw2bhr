/* Sibling of the matched sub_08066470 in src/decomp/c_08066470.c, and the case

 * set AND identical data_refs. It fell on the first draft with no probe round,
 * so the two axes did not separate here -- see docs/agbcc-codegen.md.
 *
 * Everything is the exemplar's, with three differences and no new vocabulary:
 * ONE scale drives all four Div calls instead of the exemplar's separate sx/sy;
 * the countdown wraps (`if (obj->unk26 < 0) obj->unk26 = 3;`) rather than
 * stopping at zero; and the unk70 slot mark is SET to 1 inside the guard rather
 * than held at 0xff every frame and cleared. The `--` still reads `ldrh` while
 * the standalone reads use `ldrsh`, and the guard tests `lsls #0x10; cmp #0` on
 * the value still in the register -- the exemplar's comment explains both and
 * neither needed re-deriving. */
