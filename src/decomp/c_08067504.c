 * Proc_Break. sub_0806752C next door is the same scan with the guard sense
 * flipped and Proc_End as the action. sub_0806A444 is the only caller.
 *
 * sProcArray is NOT static in src/proc.c -- see include/proc.h, where it is now
 * declared next to gProcTreeRootArray, which has had the identical
 * EWRAM_DATA-definition/plain-extern-declaration pair since wave 36. Nothing in
 * src/proc.c is touched.
 *
 * The loop is written ascending even though the ROM counts r5 down from 0x1f:
 * `check_dbra_loop` turns the ascending source counter into the decrementing
 * one, which is why the pointer still advances (`adds r4, #0x6c`) while the
 * counter descends. proc.c's own Proc_Find/Proc_Count/Proc_FindUnblocked are
 * spelled exactly this way and are upstream's matching source. */
