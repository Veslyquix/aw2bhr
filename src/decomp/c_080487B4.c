 *
 * `(u16)(a5 * 0x1000)` and NOT `(a5 & 0xf) << 12`: the ROM's `lsl #0x1c;
 * lsr #0x10` is a net left shift of twelve whose 4-bit mask is only the u16
 * truncation of the product, and shorten_binary_op folds the multiply into two
 * instructions where the shift spelling needs three (docs/agbcc-codegen.md).
 *
 * `&a3[a2 * 32 + a1]` keeps the single `lsl #1` the ROM emits -- a3 is `u16 *`
 * so the element scale is applied once, after the row/column add. */
