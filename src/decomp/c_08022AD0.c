/* Both parameters are `s16` and not the `u16` this was promoted with. The body
 * is two plain `strh`s and is byte-identical either way, so the evidence is
 * entirely on the caller side: sub_08019DCC (wave 26) passes an `ldrsh` member
 * with no conversion and a computed expression narrowed `lsls #0x10; asrs
 * #0x10`, where the u16 spelling probes as `ldrh` plus a zero-extending `lsrs`.
 * Re-verified byte-exact with trymatch after the change. */
