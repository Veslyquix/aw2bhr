 *
 * Same shape as the promoted sub_08067410 with every value zeroed instead of
 * set: `effect = 0` rather than 2, `raw & 0xffe0` with no `| 0x1f`, and
 * `target1_enable_bd = 0` rather than 1. That last one is why the ROM has
 * `movs r0, #0x21; rsbs r0, r0, #0` -- agbcc materialises the 32-bit mask
 * ~0x20 = 0xFFFFFFDF as the negation of 0x21, not as a `movs r0, #0xDF`.
 *
 * sub_08067410 needed a `do { } while (0)` around the raw read-modify-write to
 * stop agbcc hoisting the trailing proc-field store into it. There is no
 * trailing store here, so the barrier is unnecessary and the plain statement
