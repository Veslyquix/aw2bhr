/* Wave 50, W50-F.

 * Two pool words, both written HONESTLY: gUnknown_08136110 holds 0x03004580 and
 * gUnknown_08136114 holds 0x02029A10, so the source names gUnknown_03004580 and
 * gUnknown_02029A10 directly and agbcc parks the addresses itself. Note it does
 * so ASYMMETRICALLY -- the first arm reaches gUnknown_02029A10 through a direct
 * `ldr =sym` and the second through its own .rodata word -- which reproduces
 * without any spelling difference between the two arms.
 *
 * The entry address must NOT be bound to a local pointer. With
 * `e = &gUnknown_02029A10[a1].entries[a2]` the address associates as
 * `(a2*0x24 + base) + a1*0xb4` and costs a `mov` copy at each of the three
 * sites; written out in full at every use, CSE associates it the ROM's way,
 * `(a2*0x24 + a1*0xb4) + base`, and the constant 0xb4's register becomes the
 * multiply's destination so no copy is needed. Six bytes over three sites.
 *
 * The 085D6A48 ROW, by contrast, IS a local: the ROM holds &row[0] across the
 * whole function and reads it at [r3] and [r3,#4].
