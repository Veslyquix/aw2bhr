/* Wave 55 (W55-G), matched after parks by W55-D at 92.5% and an earlier agent.
 * Both of W55-D's carefully-measured negative results were beaten by ONE lever,
 * now written up in docs/agbcc-codegen.md: BIND THE SUBEXPRESSION TO A LOCAL.
 * `fold` runs on one expression tree and a local assignment is a separate
 * statement, so `associate` has nothing left to restructure.
 *   - `m` blocks the `C1 - (x - C2) * C3` fold that was costing a pool word and
 *     the +4 bytes (six in-expression spellings had been measured as folding);
 *   - `u` and `t` block the reassociation that kept moving the 0x400 onto the
 *     shift term, and the outer combine really is `|` -- the previous note's
 *     "the original must have used a macro" conclusion was wrong.
 * Two corollaries, both of which cost an attempt here: bind in the ROM's
 * EVALUATION order (statements are emitted in source order, so binding only the
 * second operand moves its computation ahead of the first), and bind
 * SINGLE-ASSIGNMENT -- `x = ...; x = f(x);` costs a `mov` because gcc gives the
 * incoming value and the local separate pseudos, which is why `v` is a fresh
 * name rather than a reuse of `x`.
 *
 * W55-D's other findings all held and were not re-derived: the record test is
 * c_08087548.c's idiom with the subscript inline for the pool order, the fifth
 * argument 2 is CSEd into r6 and re-`str`ed at each call, and the digit guards
 * are `> 0x63`, `> 9`, `>= 0` in that order with their own DivRem/Div pairs.
 *
 * The proc parameter's struct is file-local by the parameter-struct rule; only
 * unk38 is proved -- an `int` loop bound, re-read every iteration, and the load
 * for the bound test is CSEd across the back edge into the `- 2` at the top of
 * the next iteration's body.
