/* Skips a byte-coded command stream until the terminator 4 -- the same
 * terminator sub_08020634 appends just above.  Nothing calls it and nothing in
 * the ROM holds its address; r0 and r1 are never read, so both leading
 * parameters are dead, and so is everything the four non-terminating cases
 * once did.
 *
 * The five-entry jump table is the load-bearing detail and it is what forces
 * the dead local.  agbcc only emits a tablejump when the case nodes are still
 * distinct when the switch is expanded, and `group_case_nodes` merges adjacent
 * cases that share a body -- so `case 0: case 1: case 2: case 3: break;`
 * collapses to one node, drops below the tablejump threshold, and comes out as
 * three compares (`blt`/`ble`/`bne`) instead.  Giving each case a body of its
 * own keeps four nodes alive through expansion; `flow` then deletes the dead
 * stores and cross-jumps the four arms together, which is why every one of the
 * first four table entries points at the loop head.  The values themselves are
 * not recoverable -- only the fact that the four cases were written out
 * separately is. */
