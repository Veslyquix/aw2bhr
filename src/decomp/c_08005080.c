/* The dispatch is `cmp #1; beq; cmp #1; ble default; cmp #2; beq; b default`.
 * A two-case switch on {1,2} does NOT produce that -- agbcc omits the
 * low-bound test entirely and emits only the two `beq`s (measured three ways:
 * an int parameter, an int call result and a u8 member all give the short
 * ladder). The `ble` needs a THIRD case node at 0 whose body is empty: the
 * tree is then {0,1,2}, emit_case_nodes writes `cmp #1; bgt right; cmp #0;
 * beq join; b join` for the left half, and jump.c folds the dead `cmp #0` and
 * inverts the `bgt` into the `ble` seen here. */
