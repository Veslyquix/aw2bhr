/* One `s16` LOCAL whose live range spans the sub_08012BC8 call, and that is the
 * whole type argument: `lsls #0x10; lsrs #0x10` produces the u16 the callee
 * wants while LEAVING the shifted value in r4, then `asrs r4,#0x10` after the
 * `bl` re-signs the same register for sub_08014668's `int`. Two spellings of
 * one variable, not a u16 and a cast.
 *
 * `v = 0` sits ABOVE the `if`, not inside it -- the ROM's `movs r4,#0` is
 * ahead of `cmp r6,#0`.
 *
 * `movs r0,#0xc0; lsls r0,#6` is the constant 0x3000 written as a literal;
 * agbcc rebuilds the two instructions because it does not fit an imm8. */
