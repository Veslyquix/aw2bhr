 *
 * The three registers are reached through a `vu32 *` cursor, not by name. That
 * is what the ROM has and it is load-bearing: one pool word plus displacements
 * 0/4/8. Writing REG_DMA3SAD/DAD/CNT as three separate lvalues emits
 * `add r1, r1, #4` between the stores instead, even though every address is a
 * compile-time constant.

 * The trailing read of dma[2] is discarded -- the usual dummy read after
 * triggering a transfer, and it only survives because the pointer is volatile.
