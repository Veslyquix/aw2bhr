/* Wave 52, W52-B.  MATCHED, 2 attempts.
 *
 * Seeds a whole map plane to one byte value through a stack table of 40 row
 * pointers (`sub sp,#0xa0`), built from gUnknown_08499590's +0x417A rowOffset
 * table and then walked row by row.
 *
 * PROMOTION MUST CARRY  "rodata": ["0x0816D938"] .  That ROM word holds
 * 0x08499590, i.e. &gUnknown_08499590 -- agbcc's own -fforce-addr address
 * constant for this function, which is why the symbol is reached with a
 * three-level `ldr rA,=<rodata slot>; ldr rB,[rA]; ldr rC,[rB]`.  The honest
 * `gUnknown_08499590` spelling reproduces it and trymatch reports `relocs:
 * name different symbols that resolve to the same address`.
 *
 * The map header MUST be reached through a locally declared struct cast onto
 * the `u8 *` symbol, not as pointer arithmetic -- wave 34 (W34-F)'s rule,
 * recorded on gUnknown_08499590 in include/unknown-globals.h.  Written as
 * `*(u16 *)(gUnknown_08499590 + 2)` the height reassociates, becomes
 * loop-invariant, `check_dbra_loop` reverses the first loop into a countdown,
 * and the ROM's re-read of `->unk02` at the loop bottom disappears (-4 bytes).
