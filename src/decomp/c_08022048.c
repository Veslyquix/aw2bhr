#include "hardware.h"

/* A frame-driven VRAM refresh: one of four blits on a 0x32-frame cycle, gated
 * on sub_08011BD4() being within the first 0x1000 of the scanline counter --
 * the same guard sub_08021DD8 opens with, and it compiles to
 * `lsls #0x10; cmp` against 0x1000 << 16 rather than a plain compare.
 *
 * The destination is the BG1 character base, `gUnknown_03001FE8.bits.chr_block
 * * 0x4000`, plus 0x46A0 -- the same expression src/decomp/c_08013C54.c already
 * uses off the same IWRAM shadow of REG_BG1CNT. (Wave 36, W36-L first wrote
 * this as a `u32` global and a `lsls #0x1c; lsrs #0x1e` shift pair, which reads
 * the right bits off the wrong object and collides with hardware.h; W36-M
 * caught it.)
 *
 * All four arms are written out in full, in ascending case order. Cross-jumping
 * then folds only the last three instructions of cases 0x11 and 0x19 together
 * and leaves 0x2a -- which is instruction-identical to 0x11 -- completely
 * alone; that partial merge is the fingerprint of the source order, exactly as
 * in sub_08021DD8.
 *
 * Case 0 discards a sub_080261A0() result before the blit and adds no tile
 * offset to the source; the other three add `(sub_080261A0() & 0x3ff) * 0x20`
 * (0x40 for case 0x19) instead. */
