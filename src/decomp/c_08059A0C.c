/* The c_0804151C.c list builder with a different predicate: walks every map
 * cell, and for each passable one whose terrain code is accepted by
 * gUnknown_085767D5 and whose unit id sub_08026FD0 does not reject against
 * gUnknown_03003F38, appends {x, y, terrain} to the caller's buffer. Terminated
 * by a 0xFFFF value halfword; returns the element count as a pointer
 * difference against the buffer's START, which is kept in sl.
 *
 * The start pointer is a SECOND local copied from `out`, not a second read of
 * the parameter: the ROM does `adds r4,r0,#0` then `mov sl,r4`, where
 * `start = (struct Unk59A0CCell *)a1` alongside `out` gives `mov sl,r0` then
 * `mov r4,sl` -- the two instructions in the other order. That was the entire
 * residual at 98.7%.
 *
 * Cell addressing is sub_080415E4's idiom -- p, then t, then rows, then off,
 * then cells, each its own local -- which is what keeps 0x417A and 0x1432 in
 * pool words rather than folding either into a load displacement. The offset
 * here is 0x1432, not sub_080415E4's 0x12.
 *
 * `cells[off]` is written TWICE rather than bound to a local: the ROM loads the
 * byte twice off one CSE'd address (`ldrb r1,[r2]` before the table lookup and
 * again as the second argument), which is the discriminator against
 * sub_080415E4's `cell` local.
