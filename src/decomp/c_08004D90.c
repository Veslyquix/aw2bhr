 * Both arms computing the full pointer is what the ROM shows: the
 * `ldr =gBG0TilemapBuffer` literal is duplicated per arm and the
 * common tail (scale, deref, add) is cross-jumped after the merge.
 *
 * The (u32) on the tile index is load-bearing: with a signed index
 * agbcc distributes the u16 scale over it and emits `lsls #6;
 * adds #6` instead of the ROM's `lsls #5; adds #3; lsls #1`. */
