/* Promoted from assembly; each function below is byte-for-byte

/* m4aSoundInit. The `& ~1` on sub_0806F7C8's address clears the THUMB bit so
 * the function can be copied as DATA into IWRAM; agbcc materialises -2 as
 * `movs r1,#2; rsbs r1,r1,#0`. CpuSet's third argument is the mode word --
 * 0x100 units with bit 26 (32-bit) set -- not an address.
 *
 * The loop bound is the ABSOLUTE SYMBOL gNumMusicPlayers, not the literal 11;
 * see its comment in unknown-globals.h. It is read AFTER the four setup calls,
 * not in the declaration's initialiser -- reading it up front is size-exact but
 * moves the `lsls`/`lsrs` pair into the prologue and the pool word two slots
 * earlier (measured, 75.0%).
 *
 * Being opaque is also what keeps gUnknown_03005BE0 out of a `.rodata`
 * address-constant word: with a literal bound the loop carries one more live
 * value, LICM hoists the address, and the store becomes a double indirection
 * through r7.
