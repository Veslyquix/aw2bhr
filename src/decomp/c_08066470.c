/* The third member of the affine-sprite tick cluster (sub_08027B68 /
 * sub_08027CC8 / src/decomp/c_0806E240.c): four Div calls building the 2x2
 * matrix from a fixed angle-0 sin/cos pair scaled by 16, each divided by a
 * scale guarded against zero, then the sprite goes out at a fixed OAM slot.
 * Its parameter is `struct Unk08580934_Obj *` and not a proc -- +0x1c, +0x26,
 * +0x28 and +0x2a are already that struct's members, and +0x26 as a proc would
 * sit inside proc_mark.
 *
 * The scale is an INTERPOLATION, which is what makes this member different: it
 * ramps sx up 0 -> 0xc0 and sy down 0x1c0 -> 0x100 over four frames as unk26
 * counts down, so the sprite stretches horizontally while it settles.
 *
 * `obj->unk26` is s16, and the two accesses disagree for the reason recorded
 * on sub_08027B68's unk48: the standalone read is `ldrsh`, while the `--` uses
 * `ldrh` because force_to_mode drops the sign extension when the only
 * consumers are a halfword store and a truncated `== 0` test. The test here is
 * `lsls #0x10; cmp #0` on the value still in the register rather than a
 * re-load, which is the same source with no call in between -- sub_08027B68
 * re-loads with `ldrsh` only because PutSpriteExt clobbers memory first.
 *
 * gUnknown_03001FBC is declared s16 and read here with `ldrb`; that is
 * sub_08015C30's u8 parameter folding the truncation into the load, not
 * evidence about the global. */
