/* Repaint the whole panel for record `p`: refresh from p->unk1e, clear the two
 * text windows of *gUnknown_08499578, blank the two halfwords at +0x6e and
 * +0xae, redraw the p->unk1f + 1 field and flush.
 *
 * gUnknown_08499578 is `u16 *`, so +0x6e and +0xae are elements 0x37 and 0x57;
 * both are past `strh`'s imm5 * 2 limit, which is what turns the second into
 * the `adds r0, #0x40` continuation of the first address rather than its own
 * pool word.
 *
 * The zero in r4 is one value doing four jobs -- both sub_08012BC8 sixth
 * arguments, both `strh`s and sub_08014B0C's sixth -- which is what pays for
 * r4 being callee-saved here. */
