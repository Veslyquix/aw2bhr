/* Statement-for-statement the same run as the matched c_0807F238.c, with three
 * constants changed: the coefficients are 0/0x10 rather than 8/8, the target1
 * group is cleared to 0 rather than set to 2, and the target2 insert is 0x800
 * (target2_enable_bg3 alone) rather than 0xA00.
 *
 * `gUnknown_030030E0.raw = gUnknown_030030E0.raw & 0xFFE0;` with no `| K` is
 * the target1 group set to zero; the ROM emits the pool mask and no `orr` at
 * all, which is what an insert of 0 looks like.
 *
 * This function was wave 23's test of the wave-21 "live CSE-able zero" rule:
 * `gUnknown_03002020 = 0;` is the statement immediately before the first raw
 * insert, which is the sub_08071DB4 shape the rule predicts must diverge. It
 * does not. BOTH spellings -- `.raw` and `*(u16 *)&gUnknown_030030E0` -- match
 * byte-for-byte. See the wave-23 section of docs/agbcc-codegen.md. */
