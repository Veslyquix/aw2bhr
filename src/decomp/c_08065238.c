/* Builds the gUnknown_08580934->unk34[] object row: one sub_080152EC slot per
 * live entry (->unk08 of them), each seeded with its index and handed to
 * sub_08043E3C with its own 0x24-tile VRAM window.
 *
 * The two 0x24-stepped registers are ONE source expression each, not a shared
 * one. `i * 0x24 + 0x190` appears twice -- once inside the `& 0x3ff` for the
 * tile address and once as the +0x44 field -- and strength_reduce makes them
 * two givs of i rather than one CSE: the tile use gets `i * 0x24 + 0x190` in a
 * callee-saved register while the +0x44 use gets the bare `i * 0x24` and
 * rematerialises `0xc8 << 1` inside the loop body. Binding the value to a
 * single local instead (`x = 0x190; ... x += 0x24;`) collapses both to one
 * register, hoists the constant into the preheader and loses one high
 * register from the prologue -- probed, and it is the wrong shape. */
