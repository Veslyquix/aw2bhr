/* sub_0805ACA8's sibling against sub_0805C128, differing in that the scratch
 * cell is a LOCAL rather than the caller's, and the accepted cell is written
 * back over the input pair.
 *
 * THE SENTINEL MUST NOT BE BOUND HERE -- the opposite of sub_0805ACA8 and of
 * sub_08058BB4, and the local is what flips it. `pos.x` is a halfword member
 * of a four-byte struct, i.e. an SImode aggregate, so the seed store is a
 * bitfield insert: `ldr [sp]; and #0xFFFF0000; orr #0x270F; str [sp]`. The
 * 0x270F has to be an operand of that `orr`, so its `ldr` belongs BETWEEN the
 * `and` and the `orr`; a binding statement emits it before the `and` instead
 * and swaps the two pool words. CSE still parks the constant in r4 for the
 * final compare, so nothing is lost by spelling it twice.
 *
 * The tail is `== -> 0` for the reason recorded on sub_0805ACA8: the `if` body
 * is the block laid out after the literal pool, and the ROM's `beq` reaches
 * `movs r0,#0`. */
