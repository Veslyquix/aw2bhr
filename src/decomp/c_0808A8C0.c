 * ending in a `proc->unk4c = 0` rather than the window writes.
 *
 * The raw-view spelling here MUST be the `*(u16 *)&` cast, not `.raw`, and this
 * function is a fresh confirmation of the wave-21 rule: `gUnknown_03001FFC = 0`
 * puts a CSE-able zero in flight just before the first masked insert, and with
 * `.raw` agbcc parks it in a callee-saved register -- probed, and it comes back
 * as `push {r4, r5, r6, lr}` plus a stray `mov r5, #0` where the ROM has
 * `push {r4, r5, lr}`. The cast is byte-exact. */
