/* One of a verified trio with sub_0806D34C and sub_0806D620: the same gate,
 * the same tail, three different loop bodies. gUnknown_0858096C is reached
 * through agbcc's own -fforce-addr pool word (the ROM word at 0x0816E0F4),
 * which is what the `ldr r4, =...; ldr r0, [r4]` double load is -- naming the
 * blob directly reproduces it. See the comment on gUnknown_0858096C in
 * include/unknown-globals.h.
 *
 * `p = &g->unk84;` is load-bearing. Written as `(&g->unk84)[i]` the address
 * folds to `(g + i) + 0x84` and the two `add`s come out in the ROM's opposite
 * order; binding the base to its own pointer local puts the constant's add
 * first, which is what the ROM has. Same lever as the one in the "p[X + C] vs
 * *(p + X + C)" note in docs/agbcc-codegen.md. */
