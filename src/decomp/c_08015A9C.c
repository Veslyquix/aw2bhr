 * Collect every pending slot (unk00 set and unk12 bit 0 set) into a 30-byte
 * stack list, selection-sort the list ascending by `unk14 & 0x7f`, then run
 * each one through sub_080159E0 -- re-testing unk00, because an earlier
 * sub_080159E0 may have torn its slot down.
 *
 * Frame is 0x28: list[30] rounded to 32, plus the two 4-byte slots the sort
 * loop spills at +0x20 (i + 1) and +0x24 (count - 1).
 *
 * THE LOCAL DECLARATION ORDER IS LOAD-BEARING AND IS THE WHOLE LAST 4 BYTES.
 * With `list, count, i, k, t` the two spill slots come out SWAPPED (count - 1
 * at +0x20, i + 1 at +0x24) and nothing else in 248 bytes differs -- 98.4%,
 * size exact, same instructions in the same order. Declaring `count` after `k`
 * flips them. gcc assigns spill slots in ascending pseudo-register number and
 * named locals are numbered in declaration order, so moving a declaration is
 * the direct lever on which spilled value lands in which slot. Found by
 * decomp-permuter in 55 iterations; the permuter changed NOTHING ELSE.
 * Written up in docs/agbcc-codegen.md.
 *
 * Three other things that had to be right and were not obvious:
 *   - `for (i = 0, count = 0; ...)`, not `count = 0;` on its own line. The
 *     chained form materialises the zero once, in i's register, and copies it
 *     (`movs r4,#0; mov sl,r4`); the separate statement takes three
 *     instructions.
 *   - `list[count] = i; count++;` as two statements. `list[count++] = i`
 *     computes and narrows the increment BEFORE the store and reorders four
 *     instructions.
 *   - The swap must be the plain `t = list[i]; list[i] = list[k]; list[k] = t;`
 *     with the comparison indexing `list[i]`/`list[k]` directly. Binding
 *     `x = list[i]; y = list[k];` ahead of the compare emits both list loads
 *     first where the ROM interleaves each with its own `unk14` read.
 *
 * One variable serves all three loops. A separate `j` for the sort's outer
 * loop puts it in the caller-saved r2 instead of the ROM's r4; `i` is live
 * across `bl sub_080159E0` in the last loop, which is what forces the
 * callee-saved register the sort loop also uses.
