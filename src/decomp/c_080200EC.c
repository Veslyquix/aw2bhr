/* MATCHED, wave 58 (W58-B), first attempt. 244/244 bytes, relocs match.
 *
 * The wave-41 draft was ONE edit away and was stopped by a misreading of the
 * preheader rule. Its note said: "the preheader rule says anything after the
 * `for` init that is loop-invariant was written by the loop optimiser and must
 * NOT be authored -- so `-r` cannot legitimately be spelled as a second loop
 * variable", and then spent three spellings trying to make strength_reduce
 * invent `d` out of `y - cy`. strength_reduce was never going to: `d` is
 * source.
 *
 * READ THE ORDER OF THE TWO INITS, NOT THE RULE'S HEADLINE. In the ROM
 * preheader the `d` init (`rsbs r0,r5,#0; lsrs r6,r0,#0x10`, i.e. `(u16)(-r)`)
 * comes BEFORE the `y` init (`subs r0,r1,r2; lsls; lsrs r4,...`, i.e.
 * `(u16)(cy - r)`). gcc emits a strength_reduce giv init with
 * emit_insn_before(..., loop_start), which places it AFTER the source's own
 * loop-variable initialisation. So an induction variable whose init PRECEDES
 * the counter's init cannot be a giv -- it is source. That is the decidable
 * reverse of the preheader rule and it is the whole finding; see the wave-58
 * chapter in docs/agbcc-codegen.md.
 *
 * `d++` is in the for-INCREMENT, not at the end of the body: the row-bounds
 * `continue` jumps to _080201AA, which carries both increments, so a `d++`
 * written at the end of the body would be skipped by it. y++ is emitted before
 * d++, which fixes the comma order as `y++, d++`.
 *
 * |d| is spelled inline as `d < 0 ? -d : d` at BOTH inner-loop bounds (the
 * wave-41 note said three sites; there are two).
 *
 * The prototype now agrees: `void sub_080200EC(s16, s16, s16, s16)`. The
 * wave-41 objection to the `int` fourth parameter was right -- the prologue
 * narrows all four arguments -- and has since been applied to the header.
