/* Wave 57 (W57-D). MATCHED (was parked at 72.4%, size exact, since wave 35).
 *
 * PROMOTION NEEDS A .rodata POOL WORD PLACED:
 *   "rodata": ["0x081CC030"]
 * then re-run tools/split_rodata.py and tools/gen_lds.py.
 *
 * THE WHOLE RESIDUAL WAS THE SECOND LOOP'S INDEX FORM, and it is worth
 * generalising (docs/agbcc-codegen.md, wave 57).  The inherited draft wrote the
 * second clear as a RELATIVE offset:
 *
 *     for (i = 0; i < 0xa0 * 2; i++)
 *         gUnknown_0202F8DC[0xa0 * 2 + i] = 0;
 *
 * and this file writes it as an ABSOLUTE range:
 *
 *     for (i = 0xa0 * 2; i < 0xa0 * 4; i++)
 *         gUnknown_0202F8DC[i] = 0;
 *
 * Both emit the SAME loop -- base + 0x280, count 0x140, check_dbra_loop's
 * `subs; cmp #0; bne` -- but only the absolute form leaves the shared `0` for
 * the eight u8 stores to be materialised at the FIRST `strb`, in r1, which is
 * the ROM.  With the relative form agbcc defines that zero at the second loop's
 * EXIT instead, and everything else in the diff followed from that one def:
 * the early zero takes r3, so `proc` cannot have r3 and moves to r4, the
 * -fforce-addr base moves r4 -> r5, and the prologue becomes
 * `push {r4, r5, lr}` instead of `push {r4, lr}`.  64 of 232 bytes differed and
 * every one of them was that cascade -- the instruction stream and the pool
 * order were already correct.
 *
 * So: a low byte-identity score on a size-exact candidate can be ONE register
 * too many, and the fix can be an index spelling that changes no instruction.
 * The wave-35 note's two ruled-out axes (separate `i`/`j`, explicit walking
 * pointers) were both real dead ends -- separate loop variables do remove the
 * early zero but then pin the second loop's exhausted down-counter -- but the
 * axis that mattered, relative vs absolute subscript, had not been tried.
 *
 * gUnknown_081CC030 in the asm is NOT a global: the ROM word there is
 * 0x0202F8DC, i.e. agbcc's own -fforce-addr address constant for
 * gUnknown_0202F8DC.  Naming the array directly, as here, reproduces the
 * two-level load in the first loop and the direct symbol load in the second;
 * the `.rodata` relocation in the diff is the expected form.
 *
 * sub_08073930 is an HBlank handler installed through sub_08063928; it is now
 * declared in include/unknown-functions.h. */
