/* The install half of sub_0806D34C's teardown: seven sub_080152EC(3) objects
 * into gUnknown_08580934->unk54[], each wired up from five parallel
 * seven-entry ROM tables. See the gUnknown_085809B4 comment in
 * include/unknown-globals.h for the tables and for why two of them come
 * through agbcc's own -fforce-addr words (0x0816E18C / 0x0816E190) while the
 * other three get a plain literal-pool `ldr`.
 *
 * `a` and `b` are SOURCE locals, not strength-reduced induction variables, and
 * the preheader is what says so: `movs r6,#7; movs r5,#0x54; movs r4,#0` sit
 * BEFORE the LICM-hoisted pool addresses, and the source's own initialisations
 * are the only thing that goes there (docs/agbcc-codegen.md, "The preheader is
 * written by three passes in a fixed order"). Spelled the arithmetic way --
 * `unk2c = i * 0x20 + 7; unk2a = 0x54 - i * 8;` -- agbcc recomputes both from
 * `i` inside the loop and, with the two registers it frees, force-addrs three
 * more tables that the ROM reaches directly. Probed both ways. */
