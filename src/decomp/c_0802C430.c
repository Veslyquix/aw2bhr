 *
 * As in sub_0802C390 the member is read three times with no local binding it.
 * That is what puts the `ldr` of &gUnknown_03001FFC ahead of the `ldrh`, and
 * what makes the `- 1` come off the raw halfword in r1 rather than off a
 * sign-extended copy.
 *
 * `lsls #0x10; cmp #0` with no `asrs` between them is the s16 `== 0` test: only
 * the low 16 bits decide equality, so agbcc drops the sign extension it would
 * need for the ordered compare sub_0802C390 does. A u16 member is byte-
 * identical here and is NOT proved by this function -- the signedness comes
 * from sub_0802C390's arithmetic `asrs #0x11` on the same field.
 *
 * gUnknown_03001FFC is volatile, so the store is not forwarded into the
 * compare; see the note in include/hardware.h.
