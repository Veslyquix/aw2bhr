/* The predicate sub_0807831C guards its sub_08074AAC call with. It counts how
 * many entries of a -1-terminated SIGNED byte list (`ldrsb` off a zero index
 * register, which is what makes the elements `s8` and not `u8`) have bit 1 set
 * in gUnknown_0202FDFC.unk12, then compares that count against the record's own
 * two bytes at +4 and +5. Hitting the second threshold also writes 3 to the
 * caller's proc at +0x58 -- which is why sub_0807831C re-reads that field after
 * the call rather than reusing the 0 it just stored.
 *
 * `gUnknown_0202FE0E` in the disassembly is `&gUnknown_0202FDFC.unk12`; see the
 * comment on that struct in include/unknown-globals.h for why the two are one
 * object. The candidate emits the same address as `gUnknown_0202FDFC+0x12`.
 *
 * The parameter is typed rather than assigned to a local inside the body: a
 * local puts `adds r3, r0, #0` in the function body AFTER `mov ip, r1`, where
 * the ROM has both as prologue parameter copies in register order. Same for
 * `ids` and `count` -- initialising `ids` first is what puts `ldr r2, [r3]`
 * ahead of `movs r4, #0`. */

 * a BARE `lsls #0x18` (a truth test, not a value kept) -- and it also writes
 * this proc's own +0x58 to 3 on one of its paths, which is why the proc pointer
 * is its second argument and why +0x58 is re-read after the call rather than
 * being a dead store.
 *
 * `lsls #3` on the index is the 8-byte stride of gUnknown_0861500C; see the
 * struct's comment in include/unknown-globals.h for why word 0 is the

 * an indexed `for` whose bound the compiler can prove statically. (2) The exit
 * test compares the walking POINTER against the incoming one with a SIGNED
 * `bge`, and agbcc compares pointers UNSIGNED (`bcs`) -- a signed compare of
 * two pointers can only come from a signed comparison, which is why the cast
 * is written out.
 *
 * `for (i = 3; i >= 0; i--) p[i] = i + 0x29;` is the spelling that reads like
 * the original and it does not match: agbcc keeps the index alive, compares it
 * against 0, and rematerialises `i + 0x29` with two instructions per iteration
 * (20 bytes against the ROM's 16). It declines both the biv elimination that
 * would move the test onto the pointer and the induction variable for the
 * stored value. Spelling both induction variables out is what produces the
 * ROM. Declaration order is load-bearing too: `v` before `q` puts
