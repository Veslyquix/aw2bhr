/* Rebuilds the sprite-list free chain: 16 layer-head entries linked to their
 * successor with their object pointers cleared, then the last link and the
 * one at index 4 broken, then the bump allocator reset to the pool base.
 *
 * Four things are load-bearing and none of them is visible in the semantics:
 *
 *  - `pp` exists only to keep -fforce-addr from routing gUnknown_0808F090's
 *    address through .rodata.  The global is read before AND after the loop,
 *    which normally triggers it; taking its address into a local is the one
 *    escape a POINTER global has (the aggregate-member escape does not apply).
 *  - The two cursors are separate locals assigned in this order.  Written as
 *    `p[i].next = &p[i + 1]` the value cursor is created second and the entry
 *    cursor needs a copy (`adds rD, rB, #0`) because `adds rD, #0xf0` can only
 *    write its own operand.
 *  - `nul` gives the cleared object pointer a statement of its own, which is
 *    what puts its `movs #0` between the deref and the 0x100 constant rather
 *    than at the end of the preheader where loop-invariant motion would sink
 *    a bare NULL.
 *  - `r` rather than reusing `p` for the tail: reusing `p` splits its web and
 *    permutes the whole loop's allocation while emitting the same
 *    instructions.  This one is the difference between a match and a
 *    same-length register permutation. */
