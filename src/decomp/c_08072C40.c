/* The BG scroll-shadow publisher: `which` selects one of the four BG pairs and
 * the x/y values are stored as halfwords. The four arms share their second
 * store -- agbcc cross-jumps the tail, which is why every arm ends `ldr r0,
 * =<y shadow>` and falls into one common `strh r2, [r0]`.
 *
 * The shadows are the wave-12 BGxHOFS/BGxVOFS pairs; several are volatile,
 * which is why each arm loads its own pool word instead of walking one
 * address. A selector outside 0..3 stores nothing. */
