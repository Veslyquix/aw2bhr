/* Fills a {u16, u16} pair out of a mode id in 2..8. void, not int: its caller
 * sub_0803E108 allocates the pair on its own stack and re-reads both halves
 * with `ldrh` after the `bl`, never touching r0.
 *
 * The three tails cross-jump automatically, so the only thing the source has
 * to get right is the ORDER of the case blocks -- GCC emits them in source
 * order, and putting the {1,1} arm second (the natural reading order of the
 * case labels) puts the two `strh`-sharing blocks the wrong way round.
 *
 * Wave 31: the out-parameter was `u16 *` here, which was a body-side spelling
 * -- writing two halfwords at +0 and +2 is the same code either way, so this
 * file had no oracle for it. `struct Unk02028360Pos *` is the settled model:
 * wave 29 established the struct from sub_0803DF54, where the array spelling
 * measurably differs (it recomputes `sp + 2` into a scratch instead of reading
 * `ldrh r0,[r6,#2]`), and sub_0803DFE0 already takes it. Byte-for-byte
 * unchanged by the retype -- re-verified.
