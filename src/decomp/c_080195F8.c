/* The two-option chooser on the sub_08019578 proc: Up/Down (or Select) moves
 * between entries 0 and 1, A commits, and anything else falls through.
 *
 * THE FIRST TEST IS `!= 0`, NOT `== 0`, and that is the whole difference
 * between this and a candidate that is otherwise instruction-exact. Both arms
 * end in the same commit-and-return block, so agbcc reverses a condition
 * written the natural way round -- the same reordering that decided
 * sub_0802F408 and sub_080261E8 this wave. Spelling the test to match the
 * ROM's `beq` puts the `== 1` arm inline where the ROM has it.
 *
 * `gUnknown_0808E5A8` is agbcc's -fforce-addr address constant for gpKeySt
 * (baserom.gba holds 0x03002EE0 in that word), so the pointer is named directly
 * and each arm loads its own copy -- the ROM does not CSE it across the branch
 * and neither does naming it three times. */
