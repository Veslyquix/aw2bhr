/* MATCHED (292/292 bytes, one try_match, zero compile probes). Re-verified
 * after this wave's header edits.
 *
 * PROMOTION NOTE -- this match needs its .rodata pool words PLACED. Add to this
 * function's data/promoted.json entry:
 *     "rodata": ["0x0816E0EC", "0x0816E0F0"]
 * then re-run tools/split_rodata.py and tools/gen_lds.py before building.
 * Those two words are agbcc's own -fforce-addr copies of gUnknown_085809B4 and
 * gUnknown_085809D0; naming the targets, as below, is the wave-18 spelling.
 *
 * Derived from the matched exemplar src/decomp/c_0806D268.c, which answered the
 * seven-iteration walk over unk54[] verbatim. Three things differed: the blob
 * (gUnknown_0858096C), the two stepped members (unk28/unk38 here where the
 * exemplar has unk2c/unk2a -- and the exemplar's unk2c is a WORD, so this is a
 * different pair, not a widening), and the two added tail blocks.
 *
 * The guarded decrement reloads gUnknown_08580934 rather than reusing the `g`
 * the final statement binds, and the ROM says so: `ldr r1, [r1, #0x6c]` clobbers
 * the pointer's register inside the `if`, so it cannot be live at the merge. */
