/* One of the ~40 sprite-attribute setters between 0x0804B180 and 0x08053614.
 * Rebuilds the OBJ attributes of the gUnknown_03001470 slot named by
 * gUnknown_03001FBC, re-seats it at its gUnknown_02029A10 entry's position and
 * arms a continuation.
 *
 * Twin of sub_0804CC38: the two differ in exactly one immediate (the tile base,
 * 0x50 vs 0x80) and one pool symbol (the continuation), which is the same pair
 * of discriminators sub_0804D928/sub_0804E3B4 turn on. Same three spellings as
 * those two -- `pal`/`prio` bound to locals so the bitfield store does not
 * narrow the table `ldrh` to `ldrb`, `* 0x100` rather than `<< 8`, and both
 * globals of the priority index read directly so the `lsl #16; lsr #15` pair
 * survives.
 *
 * x and y are `u16` here even though the call site emits `ldrsh`: converting a
 * u16 memory operand to the s16 parameter is a sign-extension of the low half,
 * which combine folds into the load. The `ldrh` + `lsl #16; asr #16` in
 * sub_0804D290 is the same members read into an int subtraction instead. */
