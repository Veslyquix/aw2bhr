 * Both counters are s16, which is what puts them in the HIGH half of a register
 * for the whole loop: `lsls r4,r2,#0x10` / `asrs r3,r4,#0xb` is `y * 32` folded
 * into y's own sign extension, and the outer step is `+ (0x80 << 9)`, i.e. one
 * in the high half. Do not author any of that -- write `y * 32 + x` and let
 * combine fold it. `int` counters give plain adds and a different loop.
 *
 * The tilemap pointer is re-`ldr`ed inside the inner loop because the store
 * through it may alias the pointer variable; that is free, not a spelling. */
