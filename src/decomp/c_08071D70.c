/* The fade-UP stepper: accumulate +0x64 into the +0x66 fixed-point
 * accumulator, clamp at 0x100, publish the top four bits as BLDY. Ends itself
 * once BLDY has reached 0x10. sub_08071E40 is the matching fade-DOWN.
 *
 * `+=` and not `unk66 = unk64 + unk66`: the two spell DIFFERENT code. The
 * compound assignment computes the destination address first (+0x66 into the
 * low register, +0x64 second), which is the ROM's order; writing the addition
 * out longhand computes +0x64 first and swaps the pointer registers. It costs
 * nothing in size, so a size check would miss it.
 *
 * unk66 is SIGNED -- the clamp compares it `lsls #0x10; asrs #0x10` against
 * 0xff, and the publish is an arithmetic `asrs #0x14`. The threshold fits an
 * imm8 here, so the comparison is done on the sign-extended value; its 0x08011
 * twin sub_080110A4 needs 0xFFF, which does not fit, and agbcc compares in the
 * shifted domain against a pooled 0x0FFF0000 instead. Same source shape, two
 * different-looking comparisons. */
