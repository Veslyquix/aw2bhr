 * materialises 0x0202FE38 in a single pool word and derives 0x0202FDFC with
 * `adds/subs #0x3c`, which agbcc can only do for one symbol_ref plus a
 * constant. See gUnknown_0202FE38 in include/unknown-globals.h.
 * The x pair folds to one unsigned compare and the y pair does not because
 * `a && b && c && d` is left-associated: fold_range_test only ever sees the
