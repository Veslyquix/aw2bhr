/* Wave 53, W53-D. MATCHED.
 *
 * THIS FUNCTION RETYPED A PROTOTYPE. sub_0807898C was declared `void
 * sub_0807898C(void)` and promoted that way; it actually takes one argument.
 * The body never reads r0, so at every previously-matched call site the
 * argument was already in the right register and cost zero instructions --
 * the wave-51 arity rule exactly. sub_0808A6CC is the differently-shaped
 * caller that exposes it: it SPILLS its proc to [sp] because the two
 * CpuFastSet loops use every callee-saved register including r8/sb/sl, and
 * then reloads it into r0 for nothing but the `bl` --
 *   `str r0,[sp]; movs r0,#9; bl sub_0803B3D4; ldr r0,[sp]; bl sub_0807898C`
 * A `(void)` callee emits no such reload. include/unknown-functions.h,
 * src/decomp/c_0807898C.c, src/decomp/c_08080498.c and
 * src/decomp/c_08078E20.c were all updated; sub_0807898C (356 B),
 * sub_08080498 (324 B) and sub_08078E48 (76 B) were each re-verified
 * byte-for-byte afterwards. Nothing in C calls sub_08078E48, so gaining its
 * own forwarded ProcPtr parameter cascaded no further.
 *
 * The two loops are tile-index arithmetic, not pointer arithmetic: the
 * `(x & 0x3ff) * 0x20` form is the tile-to-VRAM-address idiom already in
 * c_08039A5C.c, c_08040430.c and c_08087B74.c, and writing it that way is
 * what produces the `lsl; and; lsl; add` group and the four separate givs
 * (8+4i, 0x40+8i, 0x28+4i, 0x44+8i) of the second loop. */
