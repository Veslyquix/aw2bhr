/* sub_0805F4F8 @ 0x0805F4F8, 476 bytes. MATCHED.
 *
 * The capture/repair-target chooser: it rebuilds the reachable-cell list, then
 * scans for the cheapest cell whose terrain low-5-bits are 0xd or 0xb, and
 * either hands the winning cell to sub_080591E4 or moves onto it directly.
 * Every failure path calls sub_0805F7B8, which longjmps out -- which is why
 * those calls read as unconditional statements with execution continuing after
 * them in the listing.
 *
 * gUnknown_0816DAAC is NOT a global: the ROM word there holds 0x030040D8, so it
 * is agbcc's own -fforce-addr constant for gUnknown_030040D8. The promotion
 * must carry it -- data/promoted.json needs "rodata": ["0x0816DAAC"].
 *
 * `cur` is a LOCAL 4-BYTE AGGREGATE of two u16, not a `u16 [2]`. The
 * discriminator is the word read-modify-write `ldr [sp,#4] / and 0xFFFF0000 /
 * orr 0x270F / str [sp,#4]`: a struct that fits in a word gets SImode, so a
 * member store goes through store_bit_field, while an ARRAY element store is a
 * plain `strh` through `mov r1,sp`. In the loop both halves are written in one
 * basic block and combine merges the two inserts into the single
 * `(u16)x | (y << 16)` word store; the `y << 16` is LICM-hoisted into `ip`.
 * Reads stay ordinary -- extract_bit_field narrows an aligned half back to a
 * HImode load -- and `sub_0805D648(cur.x, cur.y, ...)` gets `ldrsh` with no
 * cast in the source, because the u16 members convert to the callee's `s16`
 * parameters and combine folds the sign extension into the load.
 *
 * `cell` is BOUND and read as `*(s8 *)cell` twice, which is what makes those
 * two loads `ldrsb r0,[r4,r0]`; the third, unsigned read in the `best`
 * assignment is written as `gUnknown_03003340[y][x]` and recomputes its
 * address, exactly as the ROM does.
 *
 * OPERAND ORDER in the `best` assignment is load-bearing and cost an attempt:
 * `gUnknown_03003340[y][x] + unk3C72[...]` matches, the other way round does
 * not. It is not only the two address computations that swap -- writing it
 * backwards also flips `map` and the `& 0x1f` temporary between r1 and r2
 * for the whole terrain block twenty instructions earlier, which read as a
 * second, unrelated defect. One statement, 20 bytes, two apparent bugs.
 *
 * RECORDED, NOT ACTED ON: sub_0805A854's result is narrowed here with
 * `lsls r0,#0x18` before the truth test, which is the caller-side evidence for
 * a `u8` return -- the same evidence that retyped its twin sub_0805ACA8 in
 * wave 48. src/decomp/c_0805A854.c defines it `int` and a promoted definition
 * wins over any declaration, so this file reproduces the narrowing with an
 * explicit (u8) cast rather than retyping a file it does not own. Its body
 * only ever returns 0 and 1, so the retype should be byte-neutral there; it
 * wants an orchestrator's re-sweep, not a mid-wave unilateral edit.
 *
 * sub_0805A744 takes `struct Unk5A514Cell *`, a file-local tag repeated
 * verbatim in c_0805A268.c / c_0805A514.c / c_0805A744.c and therefore
 * unnameable from a shared header (see the wave-52 note in
 * include/unknown-functions.h). An incomplete declaration is enough here.
