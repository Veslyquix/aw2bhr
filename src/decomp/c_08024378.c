 * Every write here is `.bits` -- `ldrb` + a `movs`/`rsbs` mask throughout, no
 * `ldrh` + pool mask anywhere -- so no `.raw` / `*(u16 *)&` question arises.
 * The byte-0 store combines two field sets: agbcc merges the `effect` and
 * `target1_enable_bg0` read-modify-writes into one ldrb/strb pair, and the
 * `orrs r0, r4` reuses the constant 1 that the gUnknown_030030B4 priority
 * write left in r4 (which is what forces r4/r5 into the push list).
