/* MATCHED (wave 40, W40-J), byte-for-byte, first attempt.
 *
 * Scans the 32 slot-in-use flags for the first free one, claims it, clears the
 * record's two interpolation counters and returns the index, or -1.
 *
 * Two things in the ROM look authored and are not. The dead `ldrb` in front of
 * the `strb` is gUnknown_030024F0's volatile-element tell -- the same one
 * sub_0801E17C and sub_0801DF94 carry, already recorded on the declaration in
 * include/unknown-globals.h. And the two `strh` stores use the register holding
 * the LOADED BYTE rather than a fresh zero, because cse knows the flag compared
 * equal to 0 on this path; writing `= 0` is what produces that.
 *
 * gUnknown_0200F720 is referenced TWICE here and gets a plain text pool word.
 * Its neighbour sub_0801E2A4 references the same object ONCE and gets a
 * -fforce-addr .rodata address constant instead. The two make a controlled pair
 * for that threshold. */
