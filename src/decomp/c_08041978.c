/* MATCHED (wave 66, W66-B), 968/968 bytes. The two remaining axes closed with
 * `gUnknown_03003F50 = (r = sub_08041D40(...))`, which materializes the store
 * address before the call while preserving its return in r0 for `1 - r`, and
 * block-local `q`/`diff` temporaries, which put `t - 1` after Div without
 * fold reassociating it to `t - (q + 1)`. Promotion needs .rodata words
 * 0x08091340, 0x08091344, 0x08091348, 0x0809134C and 0x08091350.
 *
 * Historical wave-57 diagnosis: size is EXACT (968 bytes), the whole
 * function is transcribed, and the residual is THREE SPOTS, all size-neutral.
 * Nothing structural is open -- do not re-derive the shape.
 *
 * ---- WHAT IS ALREADY SETTLED ----
 *
 * The magic ladder (`* 0x55555555; rsbs; asrs #8`) is the pointer-difference
 * chapter of docs/agbcc-codegen.md: post_shift 8 and the inverse of 3 means a
 * 768-byte stride, i.e. 64 struct Unk08499594 records = one army, and the `+ 1`
 * makes it a 1-based gPlayers index. struct Unk41978Army exists purely
 * for that size.
 *
 * The head's pointer is gUnknown_030040D8 CAST TO struct Unk08499594 *, NOT
 * `gBattleAttacker->unit`. Both are the same runtime
 * value and both compile, but only gUnknown_030040D8 puts the five force-addr
 * words in the ROM's slots -- and it is what makes the two halves symmetric:
 * `GetCoPriceMultiplier(army1, gUnknown_030040D8->unk00)` against
 * `GetCoPriceMultiplier(army2, unit->unk00)`. The cast is the merge
 * include/unknown-globals.h already records for gUnknown_08091364, which is
 * typed `struct Unk08499594 **` for exactly this reason. Spelling the head
 * through gUnknown_030013D0 instead cost 8 bytes and two pool words.
 *
 * gUnknown_03004580's rows are a PLAIN u16 ARRAY, so `g[i][k]` is right and a
 * local row struct is wrong -- the ROM hoists every column onto the base
 * (`adds r2, r4, #2` then `+ i*16`) instead of folding it into the store
 * displacement. docs/agbcc-codegen.md's column-offset chapter names this exact
 * global as its array-row example. gUnknown_030044B0 is the opposite case: the
 * `+8` there IS a load displacement, so it needs the local struct.
 *
 * `sel` must be bound INSIDE the [1] store's subscript, not as its own
 * statement -- as a statement it puts `mov sl, r0` ahead of the row-address
 * computation, where the ROM interleaves them.
 *
 * The five `.rodata` words are this unit's -fforce-addr pool and they land
 * exactly on the ROM's, verified positionally by trymatch:
 *     .rodata+0x00 -> 0x08091340   &gUnknown_030040D8
 *     .rodata+0x04 -> 0x08091344   &gPlayers
 *     .rodata+0x08 -> 0x08091348   &gUnknown_030013D0
 *     .rodata+0x0c -> 0x0809134C   &gUnknown_030013B0
 *     .rodata+0x10 -> 0x08091350   &gPlaySt
 * The last one agrees with the block listing already in
 * docs/agbcc-codegen.md, which is an independent check on the other four.
 * These are the documented false-mismatch class; the promotion must carry them.
 *
 * ---- THE REMAINING DIFF, EXACTLY ----
 *
 * 1. `t - 1 - Div(...)` at BOTH x1 and x2 (2 sites, 3 instructions each way):
 *      ROM   subs r1, r4, #1 ; subs r1, r1, r0 ; adds r6, r1, #0
 *      here  adds r0, #1     ; subs r0, r4, r0 ; adds r6, r0, #0
 *    i.e. the ROM keeps `(t - 1) - q` and this draft is folded to
 *    `t - (q + 1)`. RULED OUT: parenthesising, `(t - 1) - q` spelled out, and
 *    swapping the multiply to `expr * c` (that last one WAS needed and is in --
 *    it fixed the `muls` operand order and the copy that feeds it). NOT tried:
 *    binding `t - 1` to its own local, or `--t`; both move the subtraction
 *    ahead of the `bl Div`, which the ROM does not do, so they need measuring
 *    rather than assuming.
 *
 * 2. `ldr r5, =gUnknown_03003F50` lands AFTER `bl sub_08041D40` here and
 *    BEFORE it in the ROM (1 instruction, size-neutral). The ROM keeps the
 *    address live across the call. `gUnknown_03003F50 = sub_08041D40(...)` as a
 *    single statement is the obvious lever (expand_assignment materialises the
 *    LHS address first) but it costs the `r` local, and `1 - r` must stay on
 *    the CALL'S RETURN -- the ROM does `movs r1,#1; subs r1,r1,r0` with no
 *    re-read, so re-reading gUnknown_03003F50 there would be a new diff. NOT
 *    tried; this is where the next attempt should go.
 *
 * 3. Everything else in the report is `.rodata` reloc naming (item above).
 *
 * Three try_match attempts spent: 54.6% -> size-exact-but-8-short -> 97.5%. */
