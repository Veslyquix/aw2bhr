 * is not a guess: the pair of adjacent word loads carries agbcc's own "created

 * 64-bit slot, which forces the 8-byte alignment that puts it at +0x24. */
/* Wave 56, W56-H. The last parameter was retyped `u16` -> `s16`. The witness is
 * the ONE caller, sub_0801D390: it loads gUnknown_0200E438[i].unk38 with
 * `movs r6,#0x38; ldrsh r0,[r1,r6]` before both `str r0,[sp,#0x10]` stack pushes.
 * A `u16` parameter makes agbcc zero-extend, which is the encodable
 * `ldrh r0,[r1,#0x38]` -- 2 bytes shorter at each of the two call sites and 4
 * bytes short overall. This body stays byte-for-byte identical either way
 * (PROMOTE_MODE zero-extends the stack slot regardless of signedness and the
 * `(s16)` cast at the use is unchanged), re-verified by trymatch. */
