/* Unpacks `h` palettes of 16 colours from `src` into the RGB shadow
 * gUnknown_0200B614 (three bytes per colour at `(row * 16 + i) * 3`, the same
 * layout sub_08075A54 writes -- see src/decomp/c_08075904.c), and stamps `pal`
 * into gUnknown_0200B5F4 for each row touched.
 *
 * `pal` is SIGNED 8-bit and its sign bit is a flag: the ROM shares one
 * `lsls #0x18` between `lsrs #0x18` (the u8 value stored to gUnknown_0200B5F4)
 * and `asrs #0x1f` (`pal >> 7`, masked to 0x20 and added to every channel).
 * A `u8` parameter would need neither shift, an `s8` used directly only the
 * arithmetic one; both spellings together are what produces all three.
 *
 * `p` must be a LOCAL copy of `src` rather than the parameter incremented in
 * place: a modified parameter is copied to its register in the prologue, where
 * the ROM emits `adds r4, r0, #0` after the `pal` statements. */
