/* MATCHED -- wave 80 (W80-B), byte-exact, relocs match. Two DEAD statements
 * do both hoists that W77-K reproduced with cast-and-offset arithmetic:
 * `k = b * 2; j = a * 4;` right after the gUnknown_0300453C / 0300451C
 * stores, never read, and every access keeps its plain subscript --
 * gUnknown_02029808[a].unk24[b] everywhere, `gUnknown_02028E5C[a][0] = 1` as
 * the LAST statement where its pool word belongs (slot 6). cse substitutes
 * the two pseudos at the later identical index expressions, the plain
 * subscripts keep get_inner_reference's operand order (inner index first) so
 * the post-call sum ties to k, and the register split the wave-77 entry
 * called "why does the longer-ranged allocno win the lo register" was never
 * an allocation question: it was which operand of the sum local_alloc ties.
 * Wave-77 measurements that still stand: declaration order of j/k is
 * byte-neutral; gUnknown_0855371C is an animation descriptor; sub_08052818
 * narrows both u16 parameters in place; `e` is a local. See
 * docs/agbcc-codegen.md, "A DEAD `k = i * S;` statement is a hoist lever". */
