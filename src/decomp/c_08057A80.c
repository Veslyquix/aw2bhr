/* MATCH (wave 48, W48-G).  NEEDS ITS .rodata POOL WORDS PLACED -- the promotion

 *   "rodata": ["0x081361A0", "0x081361A4", "0x081361A8", "0x081361AC"]
 * then tools/split_rodata.py + tools/gen_lds.py before the build.  Those four
 * ROM words are NOT objects: they hold 0x030005D8, 0x02029B78, 0x02029B7C and
 * 0x030005E0, i.e. they are agbcc's own -fforce-addr address constants for the
 * four arrays this loop walks.  Naming the real symbols is what reproduces the
 * double indirection (`ldr rX, =pool; ldr rY, [rX]`).  Same trap as
 * gUnknown_081D943C / gUnknown_08499578; see include/unknown-globals.h.
 *
 * Two evaluation-order facts carry the loop body, and both are visible only as
 * instruction ORDER, never as a wrong instruction:
 *
 * 1. The numerator of the second divide is computed BEFORE the first divide and
 *    parked in a callee-saved register.  That is not scheduling -- it is
 *    `expand_expr` on `A / B` expanding A before B.  So the whole thing has to
 *    be ONE expression: split into `n = (s16)d << 16;` as its own statement and
 *    the store's destination address moves after the call instead of before it.
 *    Equally, `d` must be an `int`: with `s16 d` the narrowing binds to d's
 *    assignment and lands ahead of `ldr r1, [r7]`, where the ROM has it after.
 *    The ROM's narrowings are all casts inside the divide expression.
 *
 * 2. `q` is load-bearing.  The ROM computes gUnknown_02029B7C[i]'s ADDRESS
 *    before it loads gUnknown_02029B78[i]'s VALUE, which a plain
 *    `gUnknown_02029B78[i] - gUnknown_02029B7C[i]` cannot do -- binop expands
 *    operand 0 first, so the B load always precedes the C address.  An address
 *    evaluated before the other operand's load means that address was its own
 *    statement.
