/* WAVE 79 (W79-C) -- MATCHED. Two constructs, both recorded in
 * docs/agbcc-codegen.md:
 *
 * 1. The index local is scoped PER ARM. A single function-scope local hoists
 *    the whole `__umodsi3` above the branch and costs 16 bytes (that is what
 *    the wave-32 draft did, and its "size-exact" measurement was best.c's, not
 *    the draft's). A block-scoped local in each arm keeps both computations.
 *
 * 2. `(u16 *)(i * 2 + (u32)g)` rather than `g + i`. C pointer arithmetic goes
 *    through pointer_int_sum, which always builds PLUS_EXPR(ptr, intop) in
 *    that order, so expand emits the base's pool `ldr` BEFORE the index's
 *    `lsls`. Doing the arithmetic in u32 makes it an ordinary commutative
 *    PLUS_EXPR, and because `&g` is TREE_CONSTANT fold moves it to operand 1 --
 *    so the `lsls` is expanded first and the pool `ldr` lands after it, which
 *    is the ROM's order. `g + i`, `&g[i]`, `i + g`, `(u8 *)g + i * 2` and a
 *    bound `u16 *p` all keep the pointer-sum order and are 8 bytes wrong. */
