/* CgbSound -- MP2K's per-frame PSG driver, one pass over the four CGB
 * oscillators. This is the Fire Emblem / pokeemerald function of the same name
 * and it keeps that source's shape, including the gotos: the envelope state
 * machine has six entry points that are shared between arms of a switch, and
 * no structured spelling reaches them.
 *
 * `mask` is a local 0xff rather than a literal for the reason the MP2K sources
 * give: every `(s8)` comparison in this function is written `(s8)(x & mask)`,
 * and agbcc emits the `movs rN,#0xff; ands` for it. A bare `channels->at` test
 * folds the mask away and is two bytes short at each of the six sites.
 *
 * `prevC15` is the frame's SoundInfo::c15 snapshot, and the `prevC15--; goto`
 * at the bottom is what runs the envelope a second time on the frame c15 wraps.
 *
 * WAVE 66: this source is byte-exact under old_agbcc. The prior conclusion that
 * old_agbcc was worse was an inverted measurement taken before four canonical
 * MP2K spellings were restored: read `fr`'s high byte through `(u8 *)&fr + 1`,
 * explicitly mask/narrow the NRx4 store, multiply `envelopeGoal * echoVolume`,
 * and bind the decay comparison's signed `ev` and `goal` locals. With those
 * source facts fixed, configured agbcc is 1096/1100 at 70.0%, while old_agbcc
 * is 1100/1100 with identical bytes and relocations. The evidence-backed
 * per-function override is now recorded, and the configured profile is exact.
 *
 * Two small readings are also settled and should not be re-derived:
 *    the phase dispatch is an if/else-if CHAIN, not a `switch` (a switch makes
 *    agbcc binary-search 1/0/2 and the ROM compares 0, 1, 2 in order, worth
 *    ~40 bytes), and `n4 = le ? 0x40 : 0` must be an if/else -- as a `?:` agbcc
 *    goes branchless with `negs/orrs/asrs #31/ands` and loses 6 bytes.
