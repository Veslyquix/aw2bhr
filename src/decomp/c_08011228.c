/* The HBlank scanline buffer fill for the "curtain"/wipe effect installed by
 * sub_08011298 and sub_0801137C through sub_080111C8's fifth parameter.
 *
 * 160 scanlines, two interleaved halves. On odd lines the window edge is
 * packed as `((0xF0 - v) << 8) | 0xF0` (a WIN0H-style right/left pair); on
 * even lines the raw clamped value is stored. `gUnknown_03001408` is the
 * volatile cursor both installers seed, which is why it is re-read in every
 * iteration instead of being hoisted.
 *
 * The two clamps really do differ (`v < 0` on the odd arm, `v <= 0` on the
 * even one): a compiler will not turn `bge` into `bgt`, so that asymmetry is
 * in the source.
 *
 * The buffer's address is bound to a local BEFORE the loop. That is what puts
 * its `ldr` ahead of `i = 0` in the preheader and gives it the first literal
 * pool slot; referencing gUnknown_0200B274 inside the loop body instead makes
 * gUnknown_03001408's address the first-created pseudo and swaps both the two
 * pool words and the two callee-saved registers. */
