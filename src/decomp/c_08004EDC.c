/* Family F057: one body three times, differing only in which bit of
 * gUnknown_0200B0B0->unk00 it tests (0x200 / 0x400 / 0x800) and which value it
 * stores into ->unk10 (0 / 1 / 2). data/families.json's `varies` has exactly
 * those two entries; everything else -- both callees, the script global and
 * the trailing `unk02 = 7` -- is shared by all three members.
 *
 * The bit test is a plain mask on the halfword and NOT a bitfield: a 1-bit
 * field at bit 9 of a u16 container would be read `ldrb [p,#1]` plus a double
 * shift, because get_best_mode picks the narrowest mode containing the field.
 * The ROM does `ldrh [p]` and ANDs a computed constant, so the two are
 * distinguishable here and the mask is the answer.
 *
 * `u8` third parameter: the entry `lsls #0x18; lsrs #0x18` is PROMOTE_MODE,
 * and there is no second sign-extending pair at the `cmp r2, #2`, which rules
 * out s8. The first two parameters are never read -- nothing in the ROM calls
 * any of the three, so the arity is a floor of three and `int` for the two
 * dead ones is the byte-neutral choice.
 *
 * The `if (A && B) { ... }` and the two-early-returns spellings are
 * byte-identical here (probed): there is only one exit block, so the
 * discriminator in docs/agbcc-codegen.md's two-guards rule does not apply. */
