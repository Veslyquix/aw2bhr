 *     +0x098  original gUnknown_081D943C  candidate .rodata
 * which is a match, not a difference: gUnknown_081D943C is not an object, it is
 * agbcc's own -fforce-addr address constant for the `u16 *` gUnknown_08499578
 * (the word at 0x081D943C in baserom.gba is 0x08499578).  This function's
 * data/promoted.json entry must carry
 *   "rodata": ["0x081D943C"]
 * and tools/split_rodata.py and tools/gen_lds.py must be re-run before building.
 * Do NOT declare gUnknown_081D943C as a global.
 *
 * The two levers that closed this (and its twin sub_08086CE0) are written up in
 * docs/agbcc-codegen.md, "The ROM's y-offset is an EXPLICIT SOURCE BIV": the
 * `+2` counter is a strength-reduction giv and needs `int k = i * 2;` declared
 * in the ARM'S OWN BLOCK (function scope does not reduce), and the sum needs a
 * third local `z` so expand_binop does not swap the ADDS operands.

 * The asymmetry between the two arms is REAL and load-bearing, not an artefact:
 * the then-arm writes `y = a3 + 9;` and the else-arm writes `y = a3; y = y + 9;`.
 * Both spellings emit identical instructions, but the extra statement boundary
 * in one arm alone changes pseudo creation order and is what puts a2 in r4 and
 * the &gUnknown_02027F74 pseudo in r5 rather than the other way round.  It was
 * found by decomp-permuter (11 iterations) after every hand lever failed; see
 * docs/agbcc-codegen.md, "BOTH FUNCTIONS CLOSED (wave 46, W46-L)".  Do not
 * "tidy" the two arms into the same shape -- it un-matches the function.
