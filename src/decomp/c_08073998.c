/* Walks one edge of a polygon down the scanline table, handing each row to

 * fixed-point `dx/dy` -- a real signed `/`, which is where __divsi3 comes from
 * (do not author the helper call) -- and x is stepped by it once per row.
 *
 * The swap's temporary takes the SECOND element first (`t = x2; x2 = x1;
 * x1 = t;`): the other order emits the same six moves with the operands of the
 * first two exchanged.
 *
 * The bottom clamp to 0xA0 and the top clamp to 0 are not symmetrical -- the
 * top one has to advance x by `slope * -y1` to keep the edge on the same line,
 * and it is spelled as a negate-then-multiply, not `x -= slope * y1`.
 *
 * gUnknown_0202FDE0 is re-loaded from the global inside the loop because
 * sub_08073974 may store through it; only the address is hoisted (r8). */
