/* The three 0x0808D7xx "globals" asm/ names in this block are NOT globals: they
 * are agbcc's own -fforce-addr pool words (the 0x0808D6DC..0x0808D8A8 run
 * documented in include/unknown-globals.h). 0x0808D7B8 holds 0x0200B204 and
 * 0x0808D7BC/0x0808D7C0/0x0808D7C4/0x0808D7D0/0x0808D7D4 hold 0x0200B0B0 or
 * 0x0200B204 -- read straight out of baserom.gba. So the honest spelling is to
 * name gUnknown_0200B204 / gUnknown_0200B0B0 directly and let the build place
 * the pool word.
 *
 * The reload of the pool word after every `bl` (`ldr r4, [r6]`) is what
 * -fforce-addr does on its own; nothing in the source has to reproduce it.
 *
 * `lsls #0x1c; lsrs #0x1e` on the BGCNT shadow is bits 3:2, i.e.
 * gUnknown_03002B6C.bits.chr_block, and `<< 14` + 0x06000000 turns the char
 * base block into its VRAM address. */
