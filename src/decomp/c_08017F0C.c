/* Clears the gUnknown_03001FF0 callback, runs sub_080192EC over every
 * gUnknown_0200C528 slot EXCEPT `a`, then advances slot `a`'s own list cursor
 * by one node.
 *
 * `gUnknown_0200C528[a].unk04++` is the honest spelling of `ldr; adds #0x10;
 * str`: unk04 is a `struct Unk0200C528Node *` and the node is 0x10 bytes, so
 * the pointer increment IS the +0x10. Nothing here is byte arithmetic.
 *
 * `a` is s16 -- the sign extension is computed once for the loop's `!=` test
 * and the pre-shifted value is kept in a second register and re-`asr`ed for
 * the array index, which is agbcc's usual s16 two-use shape. The loop counter
 * is separately u8 (`lsls #0x18; lsrs #0x18` with an unsigned `bls`).
 *
 * The `return 0` is a guess in one respect only: the function has no callers
 * anywhere in the tree, so nothing constrains the width and nothing would
 * observe the value. `movs r0,#0` before the pop is what the ROM does. */
