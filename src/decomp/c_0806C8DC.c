 * negation, and on the last frame reset the counter, clear the map, turn window
 * 1 off and break.
 *
 * The three scroll shadows and their types come from src/decomp/c_0807898C.c,
 * whose data_refs are a superset of this function's -- two of the three are
 * `volatile u16` and the interpolated value stays in r4 across all three
 * stores, which is what a plain `strh` of an `int` gives.
 *
 * `movs r0, #0x41; rsbs` is -0x41 = ~0x40 on DISPCNT byte 1, i.e.
 * `win1_enable = 0` -- the same field-assignment reading c_0807898C.c records
 * for the ~0x20 / ~0x40 pair, not a hand-written mask.
 *
 * `-a` is negated once and reused for both window calls, and sub_0806C8A0
 * takes no arguments (its first instruction writes r0); the zero sitting in r0
 * at that `bl` is left over from the counter reset. */
