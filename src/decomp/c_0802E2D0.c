/* Promoted from assembly; each function below is byte-for-byte

 * contiguous block at 0x0802E2D0.
 * sub_0802E2D0 @ 0x0802E2D0
 */

/* Wave 60 (W60-C). First derivation ever attempted on this function -- the
 * previous .c was start_function's `return 0;` stub, which the delta screen
 * scored 0.0% / pool 0/15 and which read like a catastrophic miss.
 *
 * PROMOTION NEEDS THE POOL WORDS PLACED:
 *     "rodata": ["0x08090C30", "0x08090C34"]
 * Both are agbcc's own -fforce-addr address-constant words (0x08090C30 holds
 * &gUnknown_03003F38, 0x08090C34 holds &gUnknown_030040D8), not globals; the
 * honest spelling reproduces the ROM's load chains exactly. This is the wave-21
 * same-address case, not a park reason.
 *
 * TWO facts settled here that were not in any note before:
 *
 * 1. gUnknown_03003340's rows are written through an `(s8 *)` view. The store
 *    at +0x40C is `movs r2,#1; rsbs r2,r2,#0; adds r1,r2,#0; strb r1,[r0]` --
 *    THREE instructions plus a copy to build -1 in SImode. Spelled on the
 *    declared `u8 *` row type, `= -1` folds at tree level to the byte constant
 *    255 and agbcc emits one `movs r1,#0xff`. src/decomp/c_0801FE68.c found
 *    this first and its header states it exactly; the same `((s8 *)row)[x] = -1`
 *    spelling is used here. The shared declaration is NOT changed.
 *      What IS new is the size of the lever. That one constant was worth EIGHT
 *    register assignments: before the s8 cast, eight separate `mov rLow, rHigh`
 *    scratch picks disagreed with the ROM and NOTHING else in 484 bytes did;
 *    every one of them snapped into place when the -1 became three
 *    instructions. One extra live value re-seeds the whole allocation, so a
 *    diff that is "one constant plus a scatter of register names" is ONE fact
 *    -- do not chase the scratch picks individually.
 *
 * 2. sub_0801FE68's CALLER passes an argument its CALLEE ignores, and this does
 *    NOT need an edit to c_0801FE68.c. That file is byte-matched as
 *    `void sub_0801FE68(void)` and its body reads nothing from r0; the
 *    unknown-functions.h note asking for its signature to be "fixed" is wrong
 *    and has been corrected there. This call site really is
 *    `movs r0,#0x40; bl sub_0801FE68`, so sub_0802E2D0's own translation unit
 *    saw a declaration taking an argument -- a cross-TU prototype disagreement
 *    that agbcc cannot see and that costs nothing at either end. The file-local
 *    `void sub_0801FE68(int);` below reproduces it. LEAVE c_0801FE68.c ALONE.
 *
 * The rest is the wave-57 (W57-A) callee survey in unknown-functions.h, which
 * was right about all six signatures; they are declared file-locally rather
 * than in the header because the promoted definitions in src/decomp/ own them.
 * The casts on gUnknown_030040D8 are because struct Unk030040D8 and
 * struct Unk08499594 are the same object under two names (see the note on
 * Unk030040D8.unk01 in unknown-globals.h); they cost nothing.
 *
 * The map planes are reached as MEMBERS of a struct cast onto
 * gUnknown_08499590 and INLINE rather than through a `map` local, which is the
 * W34-F rule that c_08003DC4.c records; that is what gives `(p + K) + idx`
 * rather than `(p + idx) + K`. */
