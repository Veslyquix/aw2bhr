/* MATCHED, wave 56 (W56-E).  Walks the four neighbour directions of the cursor
 * (gUnknown_0849A0D8 is a 3 x s16 record per direction: a bit mask, dx, dy),
 * finds the first neighbour holding a unit that can still act, and starts it.
 * proc->unk1e is the resume cursor, so the whole thing is a coroutine step.
 *
 * FIVE readouts, each of which was worth an attempt:
 *
 *  1. LOOP SHAPE.  `for (;;) { if (done) { cleanup; return; } body; }`, NOT
 *     `while (!done) { body } cleanup;`.  The ROM branches FORWARD to the body
 *     and falls through into the cleanup, which only the early-exit `if`
 *     produces; the `while` form lays the cleanup after the loop and inverts
 *     every branch in the function.
 *
 *  2. The inner test is spelled with `||` and the ELSE-arm falling through:
 *     `if (gMap->unk234A[idx2] == 0 || sub_08029DBC(...) == 0) sub_08029D1C(u); else
 *     {...}`.  Written as `&&` with the arms the other way round, agbcc puts
 *     the one-call arm behind the pool and jumps to it.  Both arms really do
 *     call sub_08029D1C -- that is two call sites in the source, not a
 *     duplicated one.
 *
 *  3. sub_08029DBC takes TWO arguments and only ONE is set up
 *     (`adds r0, r3, #0; bl`).  r1 already holds u->y from the idx2
 *     computation, so the second argument is free -- the wave-51 arity rule.
 *     Reading it as a one-argument call is the trap here.
 *
 *  4. TWO wave-17 ANCHORS, and the function does not close without either.
 *     There are three loop-invariant address constants and two callee-saved
 *     hi registers, so the allocation is decided by which pseudo is created
 *     first, i.e. by source order:
 *       - `pp = &gUnits;` in the PREHEADER (after the guard, before
 *         the loop) is c_08026100.c's idiom exactly.  Without it agbcc hoists
 *         &gUnknown_03003100 instead and gUnits gets an inline pool
 *         word every iteration.
 *       - `ec = &gUnknown_030033EC;` as the first statement of the else-arm,
 *         BEFORE the sub_08029D1C call.  Its only read is the last argument
 *         setup of StartSupplyAnimation, so nothing else makes the address live
 *         across the call, and without it the second hi register is never
 *         allocated at all (`pop {r3}` instead of `pop {r3, r4}`).
 *       - `cp = &gUnknown_03003100.pos;` right after `map = ...`, which fixes
 *         r6/r7.
 *
 *  5. OPERAND ORDER of a commutative `+` is NOT source order when the two
 *     operands differ in complexity -- gcc's commutative_operand_precedence
 *     swaps them, and the swap flips which register the `adds` writes.
 *     Two places, 16 bytes together:
 * *       - the pt stores must be written `cp->unk00 + table[...]`, i.e. the
 *         OPPOSITE of the reading order, to get the ROM's `ldrh table` first.
 *     The row lookups read gMap->rowOffset[] directly.
 *
 * `pt` is a 4-byte struct, so agbcc gives it SImode and both member stores
 * become read-modify-write bitfield inserts on one stack word
 * (`ldr; ands; orrs; str`), not two `strh`.  That is expected output for any
 * 4-byte struct local, not a packed-word idiom in the source.
 *
 * The table reads that feed int arithmetic are `(s16)` casts and emit `ldrsh`;
 * the two that feed pt's u16 members emit a plain `ldrh` from the identical
 * spelling, because only the low half is live there. */
