/* One of six wrappers at 0x0801B598 .. 0x0801B66C that gate a call on
 * gUnknown_0200CD0C == 1 and return a constant 1 when it is not armed.
 *
 * The arm that CALLS is the branch target (`beq _0801B5B0`), and that is what
 * fixes the source: agbcc lays the ELSE arm inline and branches to the THEN
 * arm, so the condition is `== 1` with the call as the then-arm. Written the
 * other way round -- `if (g != 1) return 1;` as a guard -- agbcc emits the
 * mirror image, `bne` to the constant. Both spellings are 40 bytes, so the size
 * does not discriminate and only the branch sense does.
 *
 * TWO PARAMETERS, not one, and the second is invisible except as register
 * pressure: the ROM narrows `a` into r2, skipping r1, because r1 is already
 * carrying `b` through to the callee. A one-parameter draft puts the narrowed
 * value in r1 and misses by exactly those 2 bytes. See sub_0808AC44's note in
 * include/unknown-functions.h.
 *
 * Both shift pairs are real and independent: `lsls #0x18; lsrs #0x18` on entry
 * is the u8 parameter, `lsls #0x10; lsrs #0x10` after the call is agbcc
 * re-narrowing a u16-returning callee. */

 * declarations of sub_0808AE54, only FOUR reproduces that: at two or three, r2
 * (and r3) are free, the narrowed value lands there, and nothing is saved.
 *
 * So pass-through arguments, invisible as instructions, are visible as register
 * pressure once they occupy the last free scratch -- the direct-call analogue
 * of the `_call_via_rN` tell. The third and fourth parameters are `int` because
 * that is what costs no instruction; nothing here types them further. */
