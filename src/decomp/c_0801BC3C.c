/* MATCHED, wave 58 (W58-A). 108 bytes, `relocs: name different symbols that
 * resolve to the same address`. PROMOTION MUST CARRY "rodata": ["0x0808F08C"].
 *
 * Two facts closed this, and the second is new:
 *
 * 1. READ THE CURSOR INTO A LOCAL AT THE TOP OF THE BODY. Waves 40-42 wrote
 *    `*((u32 *)gUnknown_03002F2C)++ = ...` first and bound `dst` afterwards,
 *    which made the SECOND bump reload the global (`ldr r0,[r6]; add r1,r0,#4;
 *    str r1,[r6]`) instead of the ROM's `adds r3,#4`. Hoisting the read to the
 *    head of the body and expressing BOTH write-backs through the local gives
 *    the ROM's `ldr r3,[r6]` ... `adds r3,#4` exactly.
 *
 * 2. THE FIRST WRITE-BACK IS A VOLATILE STORE. With both write-backs written
 *    plainly, agbcc deletes the first one: flow.c's dead-store elimination sees
 *    a later store to the identical MEM and `insn_dead_p` kills the earlier one.
 *    Wave 42 concluded this was a dilemma (keeping the store forced the reload);
 *    it is not -- fact 1 removes the reload, and this removes the deletion.
 *
 * MEASURED THIS WAVE, and this is the reusable rule: an intervening
 * MAY-ALIASING STORE DOES NOT PROTECT A REDUNDANT GLOBAL WRITE-BACK. Both
 * `*(u16 *)dst = ...` and `*(volatile u16 *)dst = ...` between the two
 * write-backs compile byte-identically and the first `str` dies in both --
 * flow.c invalidates `mem_set_list` on a memory READ, never on a store. Nor
 * does re-reading the global at the halfword store help (`*(u16 *)
 * gUnknown_03002F2C = ...`): cse folds that load to the register before flow
 * ever runs, so there is no read left to invalidate anything. `insn_dead_p`
 * tests `! MEM_VOLATILE_P` on the store itself, so qualifying THAT store is
 * the only lever, and it costs zero bytes.
 *
 * Still valid from wave 40, not re-derived: gUnknown_0808F08C is not a pointer
 * global -- the word holds 0x03002620 == gUnknown_03002520 + 0x100, the end of
 * the 32-entry OAM shadow, and naming the real object is what gives the ROM's
 * two levels of indirection. The masks 0x1ff / 0xff pool correctly as written. */
