/* A gUnknown_0200C528 list-script handler returning TRUE when it did nothing.
 * The node's unk08 is read BEFORE the test and used only on the else side, so
 * it is a local initialised at the top rather than an expression inside the
 * branch -- the ROM computes it unconditionally.
 *
 * The `!= 1` arm is the THEN arm: `cmp #1; beq` jumps to the lone `movs r3, #1`
 * and the call falls through. Writing the test the other way round produces the
 * same instructions in the opposite order and is 4 bytes longer.
 *
 * `int x`, not `s16`: the load is `ldrsh`, i.e. an `(s16)` cast on the `u16`
 * member reaching an int context, and sub_0803B55C's parameter is word-width
 * (its prologue is a bare `adds r4, r0, #0`), so nothing re-narrows it. */
