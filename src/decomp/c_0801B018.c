/* The validator for the 0x1000-byte flash staging buffer gUnknown_02002000:
 * a four-byte magic ("2ars"), a 0x55/0xaa pair that must be complementary
 * across the two ends of the block, a byte checksum with its own complement,
 * and a constant 0xf. Returns 0 only when all of them hold, so the sense is
 * "rejected", not "ok".
 *
 * The header is a CAST VIEW of the byte array rather than the array's declared
 * type, because the same object is also summed a byte at a time below. That is
 * not a workaround for anything: 0x0808EF60, which asm/ shows in this pool as
 * `gUnknown_0808EF60`, is a word in data/rodata.s containing 0x02002000 --
 * agbcc's own -fforce-addr address-constant slot for this array -- so
 * `ldr r0, =...; ldr r3, [r0]` is just how &gUnknown_02002000 is materialised
 * here, and the second `ldr r3, [r5]` after the loop is that slot being re-read
 * once the loop has clobbered r3. Declaring gUnknown_0808EF60 as a pointer
 * VARIABLE instead adds a third load at both points; see the note in
 * include/unknown-globals.h.
 *
 * The promotion needs "rodata": ["0x0808EF60"].
 *
 * `sum` is `u8`, which is what the `lsls #0x18; lsrs #0x18` in the loop body
 * is -- the accumulator truncating, not a cast at the use. */

/* Load slot `a` from flash into the staging buffer and validate it, retrying up
 * to four times. Three distinct results: 4 when the transfer succeeded but
 * sub_0801B09C rejected the contents, 0 when it accepted them, and 1 when all
 * four transfer attempts failed.
 *
 * Only ONE member of gUnknown_0200CC38 is touched, unk20, even though asm/
 * prints two different symbols for it. The retry loop's accesses are hoisted by
 * LICM (`a` is loop-invariant), which folds the base and the member offset into
 * the single address constant 0x0200CC58; the access after the loop is not in a
 * loop, so -fforce-addr leaves `base + 0x20` as a runtime add. Same member, two
 * materialisations -- see the struct's note in include/unknown-globals.h.
 *
 * The two casts are deliberate and byte-neutral. sub_0801B66C and sub_0801B648
 * are promoted with `int` where this passes a buffer, and sub_0801B598 with
 * `void (**)(void)` where gUnknown_0200CC34 is declared `int`; a promoted
 * definition wins over anything decided at a call site, so the call sites
 * convert rather than the declarations moving. Both prototypes look like they
 * WANT retyping -- sub_0801B66C's third parameter is a pointer at every known
 * call, and gUnknown_0200CC34 is what sub_0808AC44 writes a callback through --
 * but that is a separate change with its own re-verification and it was not
 * made here. */
