 * `strh 0` is the shadow counter for that range going back to empty.
 *
 * The near-twin sub_0801EF6C at 0x0801EF6C is the same call followed by BOTH
 * stores (gUnknown_03002B54 = 0x10 and gUnknown_03001FE4 = 0), which is why it
 * is not in F069 -- and it is what shows the two globals are independent
 * counters rather than one being a mistake for the other. */
