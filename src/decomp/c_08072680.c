 * (`adds #1; lsls #0x10; lsrs #0x10`) and it is bumped on EVERY inner
 * iteration, including the clipped ones, which is why it belongs in the `for`
 * increment list rather than in the body: put in the body it is emitted
 * before the ix/pointer increments, and the ROM emits it after them.
 *
 * The two clip tests are unsigned so one compare covers both ends of the
 * range -- `cmp #0x1f; bhi` is `(unsigned)v <= 0x1f`. */
