 * The `u16` is a LOCAL and the parameter is `int`. Both readings -- `int a`
 * with `u16 v = a`, and a bare `u16` parameter -- are byte-identical here and
 * were probed as such, so the body cannot settle it; the CALLERS can, and they
 * say `int`: all four (sub_0803B660, sub_08043DAC, sub_08043DF4, sub_08043E18)
 * are still assembly, but the (s16) cast below is only reachable with a
 * non-`u16` parameter -- with `u16` the cast would fold away and the ROM's
 * `lsls #0x10; asrs #0x10` in front of the `bl` would be a zero-extending
 * `lsrs` instead. The cast is needed because sub_0803B524 is declared `int`
 * (include/unknown-functions.h), so nothing narrows the argument for us.

/* "Start song id, unless it is already the one playing": compare against the

 * the id to sub_08070478 (m4aSongNumStart) and record it in BOTH slots. The
 * 0xFFFF the neighbours write is just a value that never equals a real id.
 *
 * THE DEFINITION IS OLD-STYLE ON PURPOSE AND THE `s16` IS NOT A PROTOTYPE
 * CHANGE. include/unknown-functions.h still declares `void sub_0803B524(int);`
 * and every caller still sees `int`; C89 6.7.1 makes an old-style definition
 * compatible with a prototype when the declared parameter type promotes to the
 * prototype's, which `s16` -> `int` does, so this compiles clean under -Werror
 * and the two spellings are ONE declaration, not a disagreement.
 *
 * It is also the only spelling found that reproduces the bytes, and the
 * conflict it resolves is worth recording because both halves are hard:
 *  - CALLEE side: the ROM materialises `(u16)a` into r4 at entry
 *    (`lsls #0x10; lsrs #0x10`) and then derives BOTH later forms from r4 --
 *    `lsls r5,r4,#0x10; asrs r0,r5,#0x10` for the compare and `lsrs r0,r5,#0x10`
 *    for sub_08070478's `u16` argument, spending a third callee-saved register
 *    on r5. That two-chain shape is PROMOTE_MODE on a NARROW parameter: the
 *    promoted pseudo is the parameter's home, so combine cannot fold the later
 *    casts back onto the raw incoming r0. Probed: `int a` with `u16 v = a`,
 *    `int a` with a bare `(s16)a`, `u16 a`, and an `int a; a = (u16)a;`
 *    reassignment ALL fold it to a single chain and come out 1-2 instructions
 *    short. Only a narrow parameter produces it, and only a SIGNED one -- `u16`
 *    gives the folded form too.
 *  - CALLER side: `s16` in the PROTOTYPE is ruled out, and by an already-matched
 *    function rather than by argument. src/decomp/c_08016104.c passes a u16 out
 *    of a script stream and the ROM loads it `ldrh r0, [r0, #4]`; probed, an
 *    `s16` parameter turns that into `movs r1,#4; ldrsh r0,[r0,r1]` and breaks
 *    a match that already holds. Nothing an `s16` parameter can be handed
 *    produces `ldrh`.
 * The old-style definition is the only shape that gives the callee its narrow
 * signed parameter while leaving every caller converting to `int`. Where the
 * assembly and a prototype disagree the prototype is normally the suspect --
 * here they disagree in opposite directions and BOTH readings were right about
 * their own side. */
