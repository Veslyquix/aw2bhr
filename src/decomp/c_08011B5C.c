/* The remove half of the sub_08011B34 / sub_08011B5C pair on list B

 *
 * The ROM reaches the array through TWO loads -- `ldr r0, =X; ldr r4, [r0]` --
 * and the word at X (0x0808E518) holds 0x03000000. That is agbcc's own
 * -fforce-addr copy of gUnknown_03000000's address, not a pointer global: the
 * array is referenced four times here (read and write, in the peeled first
 * iteration and in the rotated loop), which is the threshold at which the
 * address constant gets its own .rodata word. The store through the array can
 * alias that word, so it is re-loaded at the top of every iteration.
 *
 * sub_08011B34, which references the same array only twice, gets the plain
 * `ldr rN, =gUnknown_03000000` instead. */
