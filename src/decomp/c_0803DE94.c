 * read as bitfields and get the canonical extract pairs instead
 * (`lsl #0x1d / lsr #0x1d` for unk02_0 at bits 0..2, `lsl #0x1a / lsr #0x1d`
 * for unk02_3 at bits 3..5), both off a narrowed `ldrb` at +2.
 *
 * The two edge sums are LOCALS, not subexpressions of the `&&` chain: the ROM
 * computes both before any of the four branches, which short-circuit
 * evaluation of `a < p->unk00 + p->unk02_0` inside the chain would not do. */
