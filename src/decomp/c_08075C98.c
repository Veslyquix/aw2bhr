/* A proc body gated on an on-screen test, then the c_08027B68.c affine shape
 * with a VARIABLE angle and two independently interpolated denominators.
 * Three things worth reading off it:
 *   - the guard's first clause is UNSIGNED (`bhi`), i.e. the one-sided
 *     `(u32)(x + 0x10) <= 0x100` range idiom, while the other two clauses on
 *     +0x30 are signed (`blt` / `bgt`) against -0x10 and 0xa0;
 *   - the constant 0x100 is shared between that guard and the second and third
 *     Interpolate calls, which is why the ROM parks it in r8 before the compare
 *     rather than rebuilding it three times;
 *   - the second and third Interpolate calls are IDENTICAL and both are made.
 *     A call is not CSE-able, so this is two calls in the source, not one
 *     result used twice -- pa/pc take the first denominator and pb/pd the
 *     second, exactly as c_08027B68.c splits unk34 and unk38.
 * +0x4c is s16 and the two access widths disagree on purpose: the increment is
 * `ldrh; adds #1; strh` because its only consumers are a halfword store and the
 * compare, and the sign extension reappears as `lsls #16; asrs #16` at that
 * compare -- the same reading as c_08027B68.c's +0x48.
