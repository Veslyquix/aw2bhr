/* MATCHED (wave 44, W44-G). The verify half of the SRAM pair whose copy half is
 * the promoted src/decomp/c_0808AE30.c, and it reuses that file's counter idiom
 * unchanged: the count is split out as `i = n - 1` AHEAD of an `if (n != 0)`
 * guard and the loop is a `do/while (i-- != 0)`, because `while (n--)`
 * materialises the -1 sentinel before the guard and costs two bytes. The ROM's
 * `movs r2, #1; rsbs r2, r2, #0` then `cmp r4, r2` IS that sentinel, held in a
 * register of its own because the counter is a second variable rather than the
 * parameter.
 *
 * All this adds to the sibling is the early exit, and the returned value is the
 * SECOND parameter's pre-increment value (`subs r0, r3, #1`) -- a pointer to
 * the first mismatching byte, NULL when every byte agrees. Both loads happen
 * before both increments and `dst` is loaded first, which is what fixes the
 * comparison's operand order.
 *
 * sub_0808AF00 and sub_0808AF74 relocate this function's machine code onto the
 * stack and call it there, so its address is a pool word in both -- see the
 * "Self-relocating code" chapter in docs/agbcc-codegen.md. */
