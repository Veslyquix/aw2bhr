 * The shape is "set a 0/1 mode flag, then install the slot script":
 * `gFlag = K; sub_080152EC(gScript, 2);`.
 *
 * Two things worth reading off it. The store puts the ADDRESS in r0 and the
 * value in r1, which is the reverse of families F008/F017 -- that is not a
 * source feature, it is just r0 being the register the following call needs, so
 * the allocator parks the address there and the store borrows r1. And the
 * `sub_080152EC` result is discarded (`pop {r0}`), which is what makes the
 * wrapper void even though the callee returns a slot pointer.
 *
 * The pairing is already documented on gUnknown_08580DD8 in
 * include/unknown-globals.h: this is the installer, sub_080670D8 is the
 * matching liveness predicate. */
