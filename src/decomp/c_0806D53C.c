/* The install half of sub_0806D620's teardown: one sub_080152EC(3) object per
 * live gUnknown_08580934->unk08 slot into unk34[], each given a tile block
 * uploaded by sub_08043E3C.
 *
 * The two accumulators are BOTH strength-reduced givs off `i`, not source
 * locals, and the preheader ordering is what says so: the source's own
 * `i = 0` is the first instruction after the push, then the LICM hoists
 * (the constant 0 for unk46, and &gUnknown_08580934), and only then the giv
 * inits 0x190 and 0 -- the fixed three-pass order in docs/agbcc-codegen.md.
 * They are the same induction variable 0x190 apart, which is why `0x190 + i *
 * 0x24` appears once as a whole (the tile number handed to sub_08043E3C) and
 * once as the sum `0x190 + (i * 0x24)` rebuilt in the loop for unk44.
 *
 * `i * 4` is shared with the unk34[] index scaling by CSE -- that is where
 * unk40's and unk42's `adds r1, r6, rC` come from, not from a separate
 * multiply.
 *
 * The `== 2` arm is the EARLIER one in the source: it is the arm carrying the
 * explicit `b` to the tail while the else arm falls through, which is the
 * wave-45 switch/if layout rule read backwards. */

/* The third of the trio. It shares ONLY the frame with sub_08064B68 and

 *   - the bound is DYNAMIC. `gUnknown_08580934->unk08` is re-read every
 *     iteration, so it stays in the `for` condition and must not be hoisted
 *     into a local; that is what puts the `ldrb r2,[r2,#8]` after the body and
 *     the entry `cmp r3,r0; bge` before it.
 *   - `o->unk28 / 32` on the s16 member is what emits `cmp #0; bge; adds #0x1f;
 *     asrs #5`. The +0x1f is agbcc's round-toward-zero bias for a signed power
 *     of two divide -- write the divide, not the bias. */
