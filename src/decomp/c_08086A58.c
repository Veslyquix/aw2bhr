/* Draws `count` rows of the map list gUnknown_02027F74.unk04[], starting at
 * entry `first`, onto BG0 at tile rows top + 5, + 7, ... (two rows each). A map
 * id up to 0xB3 that is not unlocked yet is drawn as the gUnknown_084C3F50
 * placeholder label, anything else as its name. The last argument to
 * sub_080149C0 is 1 when the map's bit in gUnknown_02028030.unk30 (tested by
 * sub_0803CB24) is clear.
 *
 * In game mode 2 the rows start at top + 5 and sub_08087548 draws the rest of
 * the screen. Otherwise a header from gUnknown_08499CE4 goes on row 5, the rows
 * start at top + 9, and the count is clamped to the list's length
 * (unk37 + 1). sub_08086BF8 is the same list drawn two rows at most.
 *
 * Measured spelling notes:
 * - The entries are read through the struct's own member array,
 *   gUnknown_02027F74.unk04[first + i]. That is what closed the function
 *   (97.6% -> match). A `u8 *` local set to (u8 *)&gUnknown_02027F74 and
 *   bumped by 4 lets strength reduction fold the base load into the entry
 *   pointer's giv. The ROM instead hoists the base as its own invariant, which
 *   puts its `ldr` ahead of the row counter's `movs #0` in the preheader. A
 *   local set to the member (`list = gUnknown_02027F74.unk04;`) is 4 bytes
 *   short.
 * - The row is `rowOffset = i * 2; top = ...; row = rowOffset + top;` in its
 *   own block in each arm (W85-D2). At function scope strength reduction
 *   turns the whole (s16) expression into one giv.
 * - The flag is set after the call from a block-local result:
 *   `unflagged = 1; if (bit != 0) unflagged = 0;`. A ?: or a preset before
 *   the call orders the `movs` differently (W85).
