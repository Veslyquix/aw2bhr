/* gUnknown_03003F20 is declared `struct Unk03003338 *` (8-byte records) but
 * this reader walks the same scratch buffer as 4-byte {u8 x; u8 y; s16 v;}
 * cells, the same cast src/decomp/c_0804151C.c makes and the reason the
 * prototype's first parameter is `void *`. See include/unknown-globals.h.
 *
 * `t` is not decoration. `out[0] = 0x270f;` makes agbcc materialise the
 * constant in HImode and then copy it (`ldr r1, =0x270F; add r0, r1, #0;
 * strh r0, [r5]`), 2 bytes over. Routing it through an int keeps the constant
 * in SImode and combine folds the truncation into the `strh`, which is the
 * ROM's single `ldr r0, =0x270F`. `best->v = 0x7fff` needs no such help
 * because CSE hands it the register the comparison already loaded. */
