 * gUnknown_03002B6C and gUnknown_030030B4: four 0x400-byte pages of
 * gUnknown_02010050 into each, then one 0x200-byte page of gUnknown_0200FC50
 * into each at the block base.
 *
 * `lsls #0x13; lsrs #0x1b; lsls #0xb` is BgCnt.tm_block (bits 8..12) turned
 * into its VRAM byte address -- each screen block is 0x800 bytes.
 *
 * `subs r5, #1; cmp r5, #0; bge` at the bottom is check_dbra_loop's rewrite of
 * the ASCENDING `for (i = 0; i < 4; i++)`; the address accumulator counts UP
 * by 0x400, which is what fixes the direction.
