/* One step of the slot's command list: read an 8-byte record through the
 * .unk04 cursor, hand its two fields to sub_080152C0, advance the cursor and
 * report "keep going".
 *
 * The cursor is RE-READ from the struct after the call rather than advanced
 * from the local -- `ldr r0,[r4]; adds r0,#8; str r0,[r4]` off the same
 * `&g[a].unk04` the first load used. Writing `p + 1` with `p` the local is 4
 * bytes longer: it forces `p` into a second callee-saved register across the
 * call (`push {r4, r5, lr}`) instead of letting the call's memory clobber
 * force a reload. The address of the MEMBER is the thing CSE keeps, which is
 * why r4 holds `pool + 4 + a*0x60` and not `&g[a]`.
