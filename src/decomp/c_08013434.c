 * gpKeySt at slot 4 -- which is gUnknown_03002090, the buffer sub_0801348C
 * refreshes (see include/unknown-globals.h).
 *
 * The 20-byte stride is `struct KeySt`'s: the ROM synthesises it as
 * `((i * 4) + i) * 4`. Spelling the base as a cast subscript INSIDE the loop
 * rather than binding a `struct KeySt *` before it is load-bearing -- the
 * binding would put the pool `ldr` ahead of the `i = 0` init, where the ROM
 * has it after (the pool word is an LICM hoist, not a source statement).
 * The nine `strh`s are in the ROM's store order, which is the source order.
 * gpKeySt takes gUnknown_03002090's own pool word, not gUnknown_03002040+0x50. */
