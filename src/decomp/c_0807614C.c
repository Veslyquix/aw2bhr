/* Re-samples the camera-relative cursor cell each frame and, when it has moved,
 * either redraws (sub_08075F44 + sub_0807606C) or breaks the proc.
 *
 * The two sums are spelled with the FAR member first (`unk04 + unk00`), exactly
 * as c_0807610C.c spells its pair and for the reason that file records: agbcc
 * evaluates the SECOND operand first, so naming +0x00 second is what puts its
 * `ldrsh` after +0x04's. `ldrsh` rather than c_0807610C.c's `ldrh` because the
 * sum is then divided by 8, and the `cmp #0; bge; adds #7` biasing is
 * rounding-toward-zero signed division -- `>> 3` would be a bare `asrs`.
 *
 * The saved pair is written with CHAINED assignments (`proc->unk32 = ox =
 * proc->unk36`). Split into two statements agbcc gives the old value its own
 * pseudo and copies it (`ldrh r0; adds r5, r0, #0`), which is 4 bytes; chained,
 * the one `ldrh` lands directly in the register the later compare reads. The
 * load is `ldrh` on an s16 field because its only consumers are a halfword
 * store and a compare, and the sign extension reappears as `lsls #0x10; asrs
 * #0x10` at that compare -- the same reading c_08075C98.c gives its +0x4c. */
