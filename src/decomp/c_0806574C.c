/* Session setup: seeds the gUnknown_08580934 header, rebuilds the per-slot
 * tables and clears the cursor state, then hands off to sub_0803BFBC and
 * sub_08065818.
 *
 * gUnknown_0816E108 is agbcc's own -fforce-addr word holding &gUnknown_08580934
 * (the same block of ROM words as gUnknown_0816E10C for sub_08065818 and
 * gUnknown_0816E110 for sub_080658AC). Naming the global honestly is what
 * produces the ROM's three-level `ldr r3,=<word>; ldr r2,[r3]; ldr r0,[r2]`
 * and the copy into r6 that survives the loop -- do not spell the word.
 *
 * `unk09[i] = i == 0 ? 1 : 2` then an unconditional `if (unk24 == 1)` override:
 * the second store reuses the loaded unk24 (known to be 1) as its source
 * operand and the +0x24 address register minus 0x1b as its destination, which
 * is why only one `ldrb` appears for two uses of the field. */
