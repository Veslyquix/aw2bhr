 * The second argument is `b & 0xFF` and NOT `(u8)b`, and the two are different
 * code even though they are the same value. With `& 0xFF`, agbcc keeps the
 * `lsls #0x10` half of the u16 parameter's PROMOTE_MODE zero-extension live
 * and does the mask in that shifted domain -- `movs #0xff; lsls #0x10; ands;
 * lsrs #0x10`, which is the ROM. `(u8)b` is recognised as a byte extract and
 * collapses to `lsls #0x18; lsrs #0x18`, six bytes shorter. The first
 * argument's `a & 0x1FF` folds with its own promote the other way, into a
 * single `lsls #0x17; lsrs #0x17` pair.
 *
 * All three parameters are u16: the third is passed through with nothing but
 * the bare promote pair, which is what a declared-narrow parameter emits. */
