/* Family F013, the two-argument form of the fade wrappers -- see sub_08071FD0
 * in src/decomp/c_08071F88.c. `adds r1, r0, #0` ahead of `movs r0, #0x60` puts
 * the incoming parameter in the SECOND argument slot and the literal in the
 * first; the pool-free constant and the untouched-then-copied r0 are the whole
 * shape. `pop {r0}` makes it void, and so is sub_0803CBA0.
 *
 * The argument is `int`: it survives a `bl` with a bare `adds r1, r0, #0` and
 * no PROMOTE_MODE narrowing, which a u8 or u16 parameter would have carried. */
