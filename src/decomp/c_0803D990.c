/* Promoted from assembly; each function below is byte-for-byte

/* A clamped step: move `a` by `b`, but stop at whichever of the two bounds `c`
 * (the low/backward one) and `d` (the high/forward one) the step would cross.
 * With `e` set, sitting exactly on a bound and stepping further wraps to the
 * other one.
 *
 * TWO spellings are load-bearing and both were measured.
 *
 * `-b` MUST be a declared local. Written inline, agbcc folds each compare into
 * `cmn r0, r1` and then cross-jumps the two arms together -- six bytes short of
 * the original and a different shape. As a local it becomes the `rsbs r2,r1,#0`
 * the ROM has, and it is also what pushes `c` out to r5 (r2 is c's incoming
 * register and the negation takes it).
 *
 * The distance test is ONE `?:` inside the `if`, not two `if`s with a `return c`
 * apiece. A conditional expression in a boolean context compiles to exactly the
 * ROM's shape -- then-arm `blt` to the shared body plus `b` past it, else-arm
 * `bge` past it and fall through -- which is why the two `cmp r0, r2`s are not
 * cross-jumped away. */
