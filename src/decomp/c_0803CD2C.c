#include "hardware.h"

/* PARKED at 144/144 bytes, 93.8% identical (9 bytes). Wave 35, W35-E.
 *
 * SETTLED HERE, and the first two are prototype corrections now in
 * include/unknown-functions.h:
 *   - the first parameter is `u16`, not `int`. The ROM narrows it
 *     `lsls #0x10; lsrs #0x10` BEFORE it touches the second parameter, which is
 *     entry-order parameter conversion; an `int` with a `u16` local assigned as
 *     the first statement puts the narrowing after `lsls r1,r1,#0x18` instead.
 *     Its one caller (src/decomp/c_080328EC.c) passes the constant 0x200.
 *   - sub_08037B84 takes `void *`. It was declared `void (void)` while its own
 *     promoted definition in src/decomp/c_08037B84.c has taken a pointer since
 *     it landed; this function and sub_0803CDBC / sub_0803CE28 all materialise
 *     the argument. Fixing it is what let sub_0803CDBC and sub_0803CE28 match.
 *   - `p = gUnknown_02000000;` bound before the guard, not named at each call:
 *     the ROM loads that pool word ABOVE the `bne`, which no in-expression
 *     spelling reproduces. The same lever matched sub_0803CDBC and sub_0803CE28.
 *
 * THE WHOLE REMAINING DIFF IS THE SAVE/RESTORE PAIR AROUND sub_080376DC, and it
 * is which of the two values gets the high register:
 *
 *   ROM:  ldr r0,=gUnknown_03001418 ; mov r8, r0 ; ldrh r5,[r0]
 *         ldr r6,=gUnknown_03001FF8 ; ldrh r4,[r6]
 *         ... mov r0, r8 ; strh r5,[r0] ; strh r4,[r6]
 *   here: ldr r6,=gUnknown_03001418 ; ldrh r0,[r6] ; mov r8, r0
 *         ldr r5,=gUnknown_03001FF8 ; ldrh r4,[r5]
 *         ... mov r0, r8 ; strh r0,[r6] ; strh r4,[r5]
 *
 * The ROM parks the ADDRESS of gUnknown_03001418 in r8 and its saved VALUE in
 * r5; agbcc parks the value in r8 and the address in r6. Identical instruction
 * count and order, four live values either way.
 *
 * RULED OUT with try_match and compile_probe:
 *   - declaring the locals in reverse order (u8 *p; u16 s2; u16 s1;). This is
 *     the lever that fixed sub_0803A5B8's register pair this wave, and it does
 *     nothing here -- so it moves LOCALS, not compiler-created address pseudos.
 *   - u16 *g1 = &gUnknown_03001418; s1 = *g1; ... *g1 = s1;  is byte-identical
 *     to this draft, so the address pseudo already exists and the choice is
 *     downstream of naming it.
 *
 * NEXT AXIS: gUnknown_03001FF8 is `volatile u16` and gUnknown_03001418 is not,
 * yet the ROM treats the NON-volatile one as the address-in-a-register case,
 * which is the opposite of the intuition. Try `volatile` on gUnknown_03001418 --
 * and check its other readers before believing a match that comes out of it,
 * since a wrong `volatile` is byte-neutral almost everywhere else.
