/* Rejects a slot id: 1 = reject, 0 = accept.

 * sub_0801B120 returns u16 with 0xFFFF as its "none" sentinel -- its own body
 * loads that value as the POSITIVE pool constant 0x0000FFFF, which an s16
 * function returning -1 would not do -- so `lsls r0,#0x10; cmp r0,#0xFFFF0000`
 * here is combine folding the callee's re-narrow into `== 0xffff`. Reading it
 * as `(s16)result == -1` is byte-identical at this call site and wrong about
 * the callee.
 *
 * The two guards are SEPARATE statements, not `if (A || B) return 1;`. The
 * `||` spelling is not byte-identical: it makes both tests branch forward, so
 * the shared `movs r0,#1` block has no fall-through predecessor and
 * cross-jumping deletes it in favour of the loop's first reject. The ROM keeps
 * it at the top with the loop reaching it by `b _0801AD88`. See
 * docs/agbcc-codegen.md, "Where the shared `movs rD,#K` ... LANDS".
 *
 * The two arms of the flag test reach that same `return 1` by opposite routes:
 * with bit 4 clear a MATCHING id rejects, with bit 4 set a non-matching one
 * does. */
