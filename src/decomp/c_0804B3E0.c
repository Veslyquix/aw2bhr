 * disarming both halves once the counter passes 4.
 *
 * THE ROW IS A BOUND POINTER. `gUnknown_02028E5C` is declared `u16 [][2]`, and
 * naming `gUnknown_02028E5C[a][0]` / `[a][1]` builds TWO bases (`adds r0, r2,
 * #2` for the second), where the ROM keeps one base and a `#2` displacement.
 * The row pointer is what makes those one address.
 *
 * `v = 0` is hoisted above the test rather than living in the else arm: the
 * else stores that same register into both halves of the row, so the zero is
 * one value used three times. */
