 * -- an agbcc -fforce-addr word holding &gUnknown_0849B018, not a global.
 *
 * The condition is spelled `<= 0xf` and NOT `> 0xf`: the ROM's `bhi` jumps
 * to the packet-send block, so the increment is the fall-through and is
 * therefore the THEN arm. Writing it the other way round puts the big block
 * first and moves the `b` onto the wrong side.
 *
 * unk1e is read three times at the top -- once for the compare, once for the
 * increment, and once dead in front of the `strb`. Only the dead one is the
 * volatile tell; the other two are two separate reads in the source.
 *
 * gUnknown_020256DA is its own symbol rather than a member of
 * gUnknown_020256D4: the ROM builds the two addresses from two independent
 * pool words, in first-reference order (payload first), where one base plus
 * a displacement would have emitted a single word. */

/* MATCHED (wave 42, W42-K), byte-for-byte with `relocs: match` -- no pool
 * word to place. gUnknown_0849B018 is referenced ONCE here and a single
 * reference gets the direct `ldr =gUnknown_0849B018`; its neighbours in this
 * block reference it four or more times across a loop and so do get an
 * -fforce-addr word. That contrast is the cleanest example of the rule in
 * the block.
 *
 * IT IS AN IF/ELSE WITH TWO STORES, NOT A `?:` ON ONE STORE -- and the store
 * itself cannot tell you that, because cross-jumping merges the two `strb`s
 * into one at the join either way. What discriminates is the DUPLICATED
 * ADDRESS: the ROM computes `adds r2,r4,#1; adds r1,r2,r5` inside BOTH arms,
 * after the call. The `?:` spelling hoists that computation ahead of the
 * `bl` instead, which costs two more callee-saved registers
 * (`push {r4,r5,r6,r7,lr}` against the ROM's `push {r4,r5,lr}`) because the
 * address then has to stay live across the call. Measured both ways this
 * wave. This does not contradict the standing rule that `?:` on a store is
 * real code the original wrote -- it just is not what this one wrote.
 *
 * `int i`, not s8: the `lsl #0x18; asr #0x18` in front of the `bl` is
 * sub_0802F460's own s8 parameter, not a cast in the source, and the loop
 * increment carries no narrowing at all.
 *
 * The tail is unk38[unk06 + 1] -- a variable index on a 0x38 base, biased by
 * one into the 1..4 player-slot convention the rest of the record uses. */
