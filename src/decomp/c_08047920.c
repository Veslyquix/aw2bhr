/* Promoted from assembly; each function below is byte-for-byte
 * identical to the original. Order is address order and must
 * stay that way -- the linker places this file's .text as one
 * contiguous block at 0x08047920.
 * sub_08047920 @ 0x08047920
 */

/* Draw the six-row unit list of the 0x08047xxx panel: one row per live
 * gUnknown_02028DD8 entry from p->unk20 onward, stopping at the 0xff
 * terminator, at six rows maximum.
 *
 * `pal[2] = {0, 1}` is a real local array, not a pool word. agbcc has no
 * movstrsi for THUMB, so a 4-byte aggregate initialiser becomes a .rodata
 * template plus a memcpy call -- which is exactly the
 * `sub_0808B6E8(sp + 0xc, 0x0812A12C, 4)` the ROM opens with. The word at
 * 0x0812A12C is 0x00010000, i.e. those two u16s, and NOT an address constant.
 *
 * The other three words this unit carves ARE agbcc -fforce-addr address
 * constants: 0x0812A130 holds &gUnknown_02028DD8, 0x0812A134 holds
 * &gUnknown_08499578 and 0x0812A138 holds &gUnknown_085D5ABC. Naming the real
 * globals is what reproduces the double load.
 *
 * `(s16)(i * 2 + 7)` is spelled at every use rather than bound to a local: the
 * ROM keeps `i * 2` in a callee-saved register and recomputes the `+ 7` and the
 * extension on both sides of the Div merge. An `s16 y` local instead parks the
 * zero-extended row in its own pseudo and costs five instructions.
 *
 * The unk0b test reads `== 0`: the ROM branches AWAY to the unk0b arm, so the
 * nested unk11 test is the source's THEN arm and the unk0b arm is the ELSE.
 *
 * The unk01 bit-0 test respells the whole subscript instead of using `u`
 * because the intervening sub_0804769C call kills the address expression's CSE
 * class -- gUnknown_08499594 and gUnknown_03003F2C are both plain (non-const)
 * memory. The later field reads keep using `u`, which is what proves `u` is a
 * real local and that one access is a separate spelling.
 *
 * Wave 56, W56-K: the residual was 7 bytes, size exact, and it was NOT an
 * instruction-order problem -- it was the
 * tied operand of the `unk01 & (m = 1)` and, three spellings of which W56-G
 * already measured as worse (see the `SHARED-CONSTANT LEVER` chapter, and
 * W32-B for the mirror image with eleven more). `size: match` rules out a
 * pool-length error and nothing else; do not read it as "the order is wrong".
 * three instructions plus the pool-base register they displace.
 *
 * MATCHED, wave 71.  Bind the field byte first, then use a scratch fixed to r0:
 * `k = 1; m = k; k &= f;`.  This preserves `m` in r8 for the later mask while
 * forcing the tied operation to be `ands r0, r1`, closing all seven bytes.
 * The configured verdict is exact; the three .rodata names resolve to the
 * original address-constant words. */
