/* The two compares are a SWITCH RANGE CHECK, not two `if`s.

 * low=1, high=2, and stmt.c's emit_case_nodes emits the bounds test
 * directly as RTL -- `cmp #2; bgt default` then `cmp #1; blt default` --
 * with the LITERAL constants. That path never goes through tree-level
 * fold, which is what canonicalises `v >= 1` to `v > 0` (`cmp #0`) and
 * `v < 1` to `v <= 0` and defeated every `if` spelling tried in wave 31.
 * The signed `bgt`/`blt` come from the index's default promotion to int. */
