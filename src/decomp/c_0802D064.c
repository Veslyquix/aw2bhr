 * displacement -- addressing, not a member array; the field is already
 * declared in include/unknown-globals.h and is NOT re-typed here.
 *
 * The argument setup at the `bl` is the operand-class grouping from
 * docs/agbcc-codegen.md: the pool `ldr` for gUnknown_03003F38 first, then the
 * three `movs #imm8`, regardless of argument order.
 *
 * sub_0802D0B4 is the same function with sub_08042864 in place of
 * sub_08042650 and id 7; sub_0802D1C0 / sub_0802D1F8 are the two-call variants
 * with ids 0xb / 0xc. */
