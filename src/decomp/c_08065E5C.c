 *
 * The base binding MUST be block-scoped INSIDE the loop body. Written that way
 * it is loop-invariant, LICM hoists it into the preheader AFTER the
 * zero-trip guard, and strength_reduce folds it into the giv -- which is the
 * ROM's `ldr r5,=gUnknown_03002040` sitting after `adds r6,r1,#0`, and it puts
 * gUnknown_08580934 first in the pool because the guard references it first.
 * Bound at FUNCTION scope before the loop the pool order reverses and the load
 * moves ahead of the guard (+2 bytes); written inline as
 * `((struct KeySt *)&gUnknown_03002040)[i]` the base is not folded into the giv
 * at all and is rematerialised inside the `if`. All three probed. */
