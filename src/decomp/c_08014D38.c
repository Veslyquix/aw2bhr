/* Measures a string in pixels: gUnknown_084C36E4[c] per character plus one
 * pixel of spacing before every character after the first, with 9 and 0xa
 * treated as two-byte escapes worth a fixed 16 pixels. sub_08014D20 converts
 * the result to tiles.
 *
 * The 9..0xa test MUST be a `switch`, not `if (c >= 9 && c <= 0xa)`. The
 * `&&` folds to `(u8)(c - 9) <= 1` (measured: `subs #9; lsls #0x18; lsrs
 * #0x18; cmp #1; bhi`), where the ROM keeps two signed compares against the
 * bounds -- expand_case's range node. The fold also clobbers the character in
 * r0, which is why the `&&` spelling reloads it for the table index and the
 * ROM does not.
 *
 * The accumulator is a full `int` here, unlike sub_08014CEC's u16: nothing
 * truncates it. */
