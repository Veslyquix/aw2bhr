/* m4a TrkVolPitSet. MATCHED in wave 79 (W79-D) after being parked since wave 35.
 *
 * NEEDS THE m4a BLOCK'S OVERRIDE -- old_agbcc, -fprologue-bugfix removed -- now
 * recorded in data/compiler-overrides.json, the same entry its neighbours
 * sub_08070CD0, sub_08070BAC and sub_08070FAC carry. The parked diagnosis
 * ("allocno-priority tie, the ROM puts track in r2 and the accumulator in r3,
 * one pseudo lands one register over and renumbers the whole function, no
 * source lever in three waves") was measured under the DEFAULT compiler. The
 * same source under old_agbcc is 92.2%, not 10.0%, and there was no allocation
 * problem at all -- only two evaluation-order facts:
 *
 *  - `t` EXISTS TO FORCE THE MULTIPLY AHEAD OF THE tune LOAD. The ROM computes
 *    bend * bendRange, then loads tune, then adds. Written inline as
 *    `track->tune + track->bend * track->bendRange` the tune load comes first.
 *    Commuting the operands is NOT the fix -- that is +4 bytes and 64.4%. The
 *    lever is the statement boundary. Do not fold `t` back in.
 *  - `track->vol * track->volX`, IN THAT ORDER, even though the ROM loads volX
 *    (+0x13) before vol (+0x12). agbcc expands the SECOND operand of this
 *    multiply first, so the member loaded first is written second. The wave-35
 *    note had this backwards and it cost the last 2 of 180 bytes.
 *
 * SETTLED EARLIER, do not re-derive:
 *  - `s8 tune` at +0x0c, not u8 (the ROM reads it `movs r1,#12; ldrsb`).
 *    modM at +0x16 is really s8 too and is cast at each of its three uses.
 *  - `(u32)(track->volX * track->vol) >> 5` -- the (u32) is what makes all four
 *    volume shifts `lsrs` while the pitch shift stays `asrs`.
 *  - `x` and `y` must be BLOCK-scoped inside the first if, and the pitch
 *    accumulator a separate local in the second.
 *  - the first parameter is DEAD: it arrives in r0, is never read, and the
 *    function carries agbcc's own epilogue. Ordinary compiler output with a
 *    dead leading argument, not hand-written assembly.
 *
 * The wave-47 open tell -- the ROM emitting `movs r0,#1` before `ldrb r1,[r2,#0]`
 * for the first flags test, also seen in sub_08070CD0 -- is EXPLAINED: it is
 * old_agbcc's emission order and it disappears with the right compiler. It was
 * never a source-operand-order question.
