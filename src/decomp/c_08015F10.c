 * changes for a real reason: sub_080153B8 compares its argument against the
 * slot's own ADDRESS (`adds r0,r0,r2; cmp r0,r1` over `&gUnknown_03001470[i]`),
 * so this command's operand word is a slot pointer, where sub_08015E80's is a
 * script pointer and sub_08015F3C's is the blob sub_0801537C scans for. All
 * three are `ldr r0,[r0]` and the cast is byte-neutral; it is written honestly
 * because the callee declarations are what record the difference. */
