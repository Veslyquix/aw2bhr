/* Camera ease-in: halve the distance to the target each call, and land exactly
 * on it once the gap is 1. Parked in waves 33 and 35 at 18.6%; the gap was the
 * control flow, not the arithmetic.
 *
 * THE GOTOS ARE LOAD-BEARING -- do not fold them back into nested ifs. The
 * `xset`/`xhalve` blocks are reached from BOTH arms of the sign dispatch, so
 * they have two predecessors and start a fresh extended basic block, which is
 * why the ROM re-derives `(s16)a1` there (`lsls r0, r5, #16; asrs r0, r0, #16`)
 * instead of reusing the guard's still-live sign extension. Writing the body
 * out in each arm -- which is what both parked drafts did -- lets CSE reuse the
 * difference in the >= 0 arm only, the two copies stop being identical, and
 * cross-jumping can no longer merge them. See the wave-42 chapter in
 * docs/agbcc-codegen.md.
 *
 * Also deliberate: the then-arm spells both jumps (`goto xtest; goto xdone;`)
 * to get `bgt _body; b _join`, and the two differences are separate variables
 * with textually different expressions so the second `cmp rN, #0` survives.
 *
 * The Y half compares against 1 twice on two registers while the X half
 * compares once; that is register allocation, not a second idiom -- X's two
 * difference pseudos coalesced and cross-jumping merged the compare too. Same
 * source for both halves. */

/* Camera step: snap straight to the target if either axis is more than 0x10
 * away, otherwise creep 4 pixels per call. Sibling of sub_080230DC, parked in
 * wave 35 at 38.7%. Three things here each cost a wave; all three are written
 * up in the wave-42 chapters of docs/agbcc-codegen.md.
 *
 * 1. THE GOTOS ARE LOAD-BEARING. The step bodies have two predecessors, which
 *    is why they re-derive `(s16)a1` from the saved shifted value rather than
 *    reusing the guard's. Duplicating them into each arm does not reproduce it.
 *
 * 2. `sx` AND `sy` EXIST TO SPLIT REGISTERS. Binding the sign-extended
 *    parameter to its own local before either difference is created is what
 *    puts the difference in r1 and the extension in r0. Without it both
 *    differences land in r0, the two arms of the snap guard become identical
 *    instruction sequences, cross-jumping collapses them, and the function
 *    comes out 8 bytes short.
 *
 * 3. `x`/`y` ARE int AND `vx`/`vy` ARE u16, and that pairing is the whole step
 *    body. The ROM's no-change arm truncates (`lsls r0, r4, #16`), which only
 *    happens for an int-typed expression assigned to a u16; and its tail is
 *    `lsrs r0, r0, #16; adds r4, r0, #0` -- two instructions, i.e. a narrow
 *    temporary assigned into a wider variable, not a direct narrow store. A
 *    three-way `?:` CANNOT produce this: `X ? A op B : A` hits expand_expr's
 *    copy-then-conditionally-apply optimisation and presets instead of
 *    branching. Widening x to int is why the snap arm needs `(u16)a1`. */
