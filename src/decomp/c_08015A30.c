/* The gUnknown_03001470 script interpreter: five guards, then run commands
 * through the gUnknown_0848A160 opcode table until one reports 0.
 *
 * The `.unk10` guard is one `&&`, not a nested `if`: the ROM tests the member,
 * skips FORWARD past the decrement when it is 0, and returns when the
 * decremented value is non-zero -- which is exactly a short-circuit whose two
 * exits go to different places. The decremented value is tested without a
 * reload (`lsls r0,r0,#0x10` on the register that was just stored), so the
 * decrement is an expression and not a statement of its own.
 *
 * `.unk00` is tested TWICE, once at the top and once after the `.unk08` guard.
 * That is real: agbcc keeps the second `ldr r0,[r1]` even though nothing
 * between them writes memory, so the source has both tests.
