/* One nested call. The `lsls #0x18; asrs #8; lsrs #0x10` triple between the two
 * `bl`s is a single conversion, not two: sub_08016D04 returns s8 and
 * sub_08016D30's first parameter is u16, so the value is sign-extended from 8
 * bits and then truncated to 16, which agbcc fuses into one left shift and two
 * rights. Both widths are independently confirmed on the callee side --
 * sub_08016D04's declaration in unknown-functions.h and sub_08016D30's own
 * prologue (`lsls r0,#0x10; lsrs r4,#0x10` then `lsls r1,#0x18; lsrs r7,#0x18`).
 * An `int` parameter would have left a bare `lsls #0x18; asrs #0x18` pair and an
 * s8 one nothing at all.
 *
 * The narrowing is the only thing between the calls, so this is genuine nesting
 * and not two statements. `pop {r0}; bx r0`, so void.
