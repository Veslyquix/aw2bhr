/* MATCHED wave 34, W34-E. Parked at 53.3% since wave 33 on what its note called
 * a pure register-allocation residual; it was a source-structure fact, and it
 * needed THREE locals where the draft had one.
 *
 * The ROM materialises &gUnknown_081D937C in a scratch, dereferences it, reads
 * the halfword, and only THEN copies the address to the register that survives:
 *
 *   ldr  r0, =gUnknown_081D937C   <- p  = gUnknown_081D937C
 *   ldr  r2, [r0]                 <-      (the pointer VALUE, live into the body)
 *   ldrh r1, [r2]                 <- v  = *p
 *   adds r3, r0, #0               <- pp = &gUnknown_081D937C
 *
 * Each local buys exactly one of those, and the ORDER of the three statements
 * is what places the copy. Binding only `pp` (wave 33's draft) collapses the
 * address into one pseudo that agbcc puts straight in r3, so the copy never
 * appears at all -- 53.3%. Adding `p` produces the copy but emits it BEFORE the
 * `ldrh` -- 95.8%, size-exact, five bytes out. Adding `v` is what pushes it
 * past the `ldrh`, because the address constant is then not wanted again until
 * the `pp` binding. Wave 33's "one local where the original had N" diagnostic
 * was pointing the right way; only the count was wrong.
 *
 * Wave 33's other measurement stands as far as it went: naming
 * gUnknown_081D937C directly at the use sites is +4 bytes, because
 * -fforce-addr parks the address in this unit's own .rodata (a `.LC` word) and
 * reaches it through a second `ldr` at BOTH sites. The `pp` binding removes
 * that .LC. Both halves of the wave-33 note were correct about single changes;
 * neither outcome was reachable without the other two locals, which is why four
 * attempts on one axis found nothing.
 *
 * The pointee's `volatile` is settled and required -- see the note on the
 * declaration in unknown-globals.h. It is what makes the body re-read through
 * `p` instead of forwarding `v` into `adds r0, r2, #1`.
 *
 * Its mirror sub_0807FFF0 closed on the identical three-local change. */
