/* Scores every passable cell by the gUnknown_0202DAD8 influence record for its

 * same 4-byte (u16, u16) buffer contract the rest of the 0x08059/0x0805F block
 * uses. sub_0805F2B4 is its twin; c_08058BB4.c is the vocabulary exemplar.
 *
 * MATCHED in Wave 63 after splitting the packed store into three statements.
 * The configured matcher accepts both literal-pool relocations below as
 * equivalent and reports byte-identical linked output.
 *
 *  1. ONE BYTE is the pool word at +0x14c. The ROM has
 *     `.word gUnknown_085D584C` (addend 0); this emits
 *     `.word gUnknown_085D583C + 0x10`. 0x085D584C IS 0x085D583C + 0x10 --
 *     it is &gUnknown_085D583C[0].unk10, the same 0x14-stride terrain table
 *     c_08058BB4.c reads, and gen_lds.py invented the second name for the
 *     mid-array address agbcc's own address-constant pool produced. This is the
 *     "different symbols that resolve to the same address" case; it differs
 *     pre-link only because the addend lives in the word. DO NOT declare
 *     gUnknown_085D584C to make it go away -- it is not an object.
 *
 *  2. TWO BYTES are one transposition in the packed store. The ROM interleaves
 *     the (u16)x truncation with the y shift:
 *         lsls r0, r5, #16 / lsls r1, r6, #16 / lsrs r0, r0, #16 / orrs r0, r1
 *     Wave 63 reached that order by making the two shifted values real
 *     temporaries before the store: `xp = x << 16; yp = y << 16;` followed by
 *     `(xp >> 16) | yp`. This is the same scheduling lever independently found
 *     on sub_0805EB58. Earlier one-expression, comma-anchor, split-store and
 *     540-second permuter probes did not reach the interleaving.
 *
 *  3. WHAT THE PERMUTER FOUND, and it is a general result: `p` must be assigned
 *     AFTER the loop nest, not before it and not inside it. The ROM binds &v in
 *     the loop-guard block, between `ldr r2,[r0]` and `ldrh r3,[r2,#2]`.
 *     Assigned before the `for` it lands ahead of the map load; assigned in
 *     either loop body LICM hoists it past the guard branch; assigned after the
 *     loop it lands exactly where the ROM has it. That one move took this from
 *     95.8% to 98.9% and fixed six register assignments at once.
 *
 * TWO MORE THINGS MEASURED HERE, both worth reusing:
 *  - `cx`/`cy` MUST be bound before the gUnknown_0202DAD8 subscript. Written
 *    inline as gUnknown_0202DAD8[y / 4][x / 4], agbcc interleaves the second
 *    division with the first multiply and needs an extra `mov r2, r1` to get
 *    x / 4 into the multiply's destination (+2 bytes). Bound, both divisions
 *    are emitted first, exactly as the ROM does.
 *  - That same change FLIPPED which address constant wins sl. Inline,
 *    gUnknown_085D5ABC took the callee-saved register and
 *    gUnknown_085D583C+0x10 was rematerialised; bound, it is the other way
 *    round, which is what the ROM has. So the "pseudo created first wins the
 *    callee-saved register" tie-break was NOT the lever -- the lever was a
 *    pressure change two statements earlier. Chasing the pool order directly
 *    would have missed it.
 *
 * gUnknown_0816DAA4 is NOT an object: the ROM word holds 0x030040D8, verified
 * in baserom.gba, so it is agbcc's own -fforce-addr address constant for
 * gUnknown_030040D8. Naming gUnknown_030040D8 honestly is correct and the
 * promotion carries "rodata": ["0x0816DAA4"] -- same reading as W48-J's
 * gUnknown_0816D93C -> gUnknown_08499590. */
