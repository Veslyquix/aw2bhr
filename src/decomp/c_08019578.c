/* Rewrites two OBJ attribute pairs in the proc's own buffer -- entry 0 and the
 * entry the proc's unk1e selects, in both of two 0x40-byte halves -- and then
 * calls the proc's stored callback.
 *
 * unk18 is a `u16 *`, so the ROM's byte offsets are element indices: 0x40 is
 * [0x20] and the `unk1e * 8` scaling is `unk1e * 4` elements. The `adds r1,
 * #0x40` / `adds r1, #8` chain is addressing, not a member array: 0x40 is past
 * `strh`'s 5-bit displacement, and the second offset is CSEd off the first.
 *
 * unk1e and unk30 are each named TWICE and reloaded both times -- the `strh`
 * in between may alias them, so CSE does not fire and neither should a bound
 * local. The pointer at +0x18 IS loaded once, because nothing writes through
 * anything that could alias it before the second use. */
