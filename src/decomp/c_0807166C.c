/* Wave 80 (W80-C): BYTE-EXACT UNDER compiler_profile "old-agbcc" (the m4a
 * block override its three matched neighbours sub_08071564 / sub_08071584 /
 * sub_080715F8 carry in data/compiler-overrides.json: cc1 old_agbcc, remove
 * -fprologue-bugfix). Provisional until the orchestrator records the
 * override entry and re-runs the configured verdict. Under the DEFAULT
 * profile this same source is NOT exact (the case bodies rotate r0/r1 and the
 * offset+base add commutes), so the override is required, not cosmetic.
 *
 * Every number quoted in this header before wave 80 was measured under the
 * default profile and does not describe this function. Two source facts
 * closed it once the profile was right, and NEITHER is an allocation lever:
 *
 * 1. ONE SHARED CALL/SKIP TAIL, not twelve. The twelve comparison arms reach
 *    a single `gUnknown_03005744(a, b)` block by `break` and a single
 *    `b->unk40 += 4` block by `goto skip`; cases 0-5 and default `return`.
 *    The old draft wrote the call and the skip out in all twelve arms and
 *    relied on cross-jumping to fold them, which reproduces the INSTRUCTION
 *    STREAM but not the ALLOCATION: gcc 2.95 cross-jumps only in the
 *    post-reload jump pass, so at global_alloc time the written-out arms give
 *    `b` ~36 extra refs and the top priority (b -> r4, a -> r5, op -> r6).
 *    With one tail `b` has 7 refs against `a`'s 11 and the ROM's order
 *    a -> r4, op -> r5, b -> r6 falls out. This is the wave-79 "no source
 *    construct" residual: the construct was the tail, and the wave-79
 *    direction ("shorten op's range or lengthen b's") was pointing at the
 *    wrong variable -- it is b's REF COUNT.
 *
 * 2. THE THIRD WRITE-BACK IS SPELLED FROM THE SECOND ADVANCED POINTER.
 *    `nxt2 = nxt + 1; b->unk40 = nxt2; v = nxt[1]; b->unk40 = nxt2 + 1;`
 *    gives the ROM's `adds r0, r2, #1; str; ldrb r2, [r2, #1]; adds r0, #1;
 *    str`. Under default this local was 0.3% worse (W77-E) because default
 *    CSE chained the stores by itself; old_agbcc does not, and without the
 *    local it recomputes cur+3 from the original cursor (`adds r0, #3`).
 *    `*cur++` and `*b->unk40++` forms both lose the chain under old-agbcc
 *    too (measured this wave).
 *
 * And one wave-77 lever is REVERSED under old-agbcc: the split statement
 * `p = a->unk18; p = p + cur[1];` loads the base straight into p's register
 * (r3) and adds `r0 + r3`; the ROM loads the base into a scratch (r0) and
 * adds `r1 + r0`. The plain `p = a->unk18 + cur[1];` does exactly that under
 * old-agbcc (`cur[1] + a->unk18` and `&a->unk18[cur[1]]` are byte-identical
 * to it). Under default the plain form put the ldrb ahead of the ldr, which
 * is why wave 77 split it; that finding was about the default allocator.
 *
 * Kept from earlier waves, still true under old-agbcc: `v` is a 32-bit
 * local; gUnknown_03005744 is a two-argument function pointer; the opcode
 * map is 0-2 store/add/subtract an immediate, 3-5 the same through
 * a->unk18[operand], 6-11 compare against the immediate and 12-17 against
 * a->unk18[operand], in the order ==, !=, >, >=, <=, <. Case 17's branch is
 * inverted because its arm falls through into the call block. */
