 * NEEDS ITS .rodata POOL WORD PLACED. Add to this function's
 * data/promoted.json entry:
 *     "rodata": ["0x08090D80"]
 * then re-run tools/split_rodata.py and tools/gen_lds.py before building.
 * 0x08090D80 holds 0x0849BC30, i.e. &gUnknown_0849BC30 -- agbcc's own
 * -fforce-addr address constant. The honest spelling reproduces it here
 * because this loop body is under enough register pressure (r8, r9 and sl all
 * in use) that agbcc spills the address by itself. Its neighbour 0x08090D7C
 * is the SAME construct for sub_08033EC8 and does NOT behave this way; see
 * that function's note, which is the useful half of this pair.
 *
 * PROMOTION WARNING -- NON-CONSECUTIVE POOL WORDS. 0x08090D7C, 0x08090D80 and
 * 0x08090D8C are pool words of this one translation unit, but 0x08090D84 and
 * 0x08090D88 sitting between them belong to sub_080344F0 and sub_080345C8,
 * which are promoted separately and reach them by name. split_rodata.py
 * requires a unit's claimed words to be CONSECUTIVE, so this unit and
 * sub_080346FC's may need to be carved or split together.
 *
 * Binding `gUnknown_0849BC30[proc->unk30[i]]` to `p` is load-bearing, and is
 * the same single fact as in sub_08033EC8: written inline the argument
 * expressions are emitted in the wrong order (the 0x1ff mask and the `& 0xff`
 * ahead of the table lookup), and it ALSO flipped r3/r5 between the two
 * branches. One binding fixed both, which is why the r3/r5 mirror was never a
 * separate problem worth chasing.
 *
 * `((const u16 *)gUnknown_0849BC38)[i]` is a CAST AT THIS USE, not evidence
 * that the object should be retyped. The array is declared `const u8[]` and
 * the promoted c_08033FFC.c depends on `gUnknown_0849BC38[2]` compiling to a
 * `ldrb` of byte 2; widening the declaration would turn that into `ldrh` of
 * byte 4 and silently regress two already-matched functions. The object is
 * three u16s and the u8 readers take their low halves -- both views are
 * consistent on little-endian. */
