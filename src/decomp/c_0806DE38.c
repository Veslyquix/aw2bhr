/* The `(s16)` on unk2a is load-bearing and is the whole 41.8%-vs-match diff:
 * the member is declared u16, and a bare read gives `ldrh r0,[r0,#0x2a]` where
 * the ROM has `movs r1,#0x2a; ldrsh r0,[r0,r1]`. Probed: an (s16) cast on a
 * u16 STRUCT MEMBER folds into a sign-extending load rather than expanding to
 * lsls/asrs, so it costs nothing and does not need the shared member retyped.
