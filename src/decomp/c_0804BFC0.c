/* Promoted from assembly; each function below is byte-for-byte

/* The sub_0804EEFC OAM-rebuild idiom with the tail cut off: fetch the slot's
 * attributes with sub_0801566C, rewrite four bitfields, hand them back with
 * sub_08015608. Every global it touches is a strict subset of sub_0804EEFC's,
 * so the type model came over whole and nothing here is newly declared -- the
 * data_refs-subset axis delivering exactly what it claims.
 *
 * The one thing the exemplar does NOT supply is column 9 of gUnknown_085D6A48.
 * The ROM reads it as `adds r0, r0, r3; ldrh r0, [r0, #0x12]` -- the column
 * offset in the LOAD DISPLACEMENT -- which the declared `u16 [][12]` cannot
 * emit, because fold pulls the INTEGER_CST out of the address PLUS and
 * reassociates `base + X*24 + 18` into `(base + 18) + X*24`. A COMPONENT_REF
 * applies its offset to the MEM instead. The row struct is declared locally
 * rather than retyping the global, exactly as the note on gUnknown_085D6A48 in
 * include/unknown-globals.h asks: the four promoted readers all use column 0
 * and the array spelling is settled there.
 *
 * THE TILENUM STATEMENT, closed in wave 20 by W20-A on the axis W20-B named.
 * The ROM needs three things at once and every comma spelling gets two:
 *   1. `a * 0x100` emitted FIRST (`lsls r2, r4, #8` ahead of both pool loads);
 *   2. &gUnknown_085D6A48's pseudo created before &gUnknown_03004580's, so the
 *      pool words come out in that order;
 *   3. the multiply destination-tied to the LOADED value (`muls r0, r6`, not
 *      `adds r1,r6,#0; muls r1,r0; adds r0,r1,#0`).
 * W20-B measured four comma spellings: none reaches all three, because binding
 * the loaded value inside a comma drags the whole right operand of the `+`
 * forward and loses (1). The fix is to stop using commas: give each of the
 * three values its own STATEMENT, in the order the ROM computes them. Then
 * nothing can be hoisted past anything else, `s` and `t` each die at their use,
 * and the multiply ties to `t`.
 *   The general rule, and it is the useful direction: a comma operator moves
 * ONE reference to a point no statement boundary can reach, and it drags its
 * whole subexpression with it. When a statement needs TWO values pinned in
 * opposite directions, the comma cannot do it and separate statements can --
 * so try the plain spelling BEFORE reaching for a second comma, not after.
 * (`s = a * 0x100;` bound and the rows comma kept is byte-identical to this,
 * so it is the SEPARATION that matters, not which construct does it.) */
