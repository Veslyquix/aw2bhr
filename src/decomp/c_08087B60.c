 * Both `adds` immediates are absent from `varies`, so only the two callees

 * This is NOT the wave-14 F032 shape: there is no `lsls r0,#0x18; cmp r0,#0;
 * bne`, so the second call is unconditional and the first callee's result is
 * discarded. Whether the FIRST call receives the incoming r0 is decided
 * callee-side and the three members do not agree on it -- see each below.
 * `pop {r4}; pop {r0}` is still the void epilogue.
