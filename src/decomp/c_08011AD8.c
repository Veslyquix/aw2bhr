 *
 * gUnknown_030030E8 is the volatile count, read once for the zero-trip guard
 * (`ldrh; lsls #0x10; cmp #0; ble` -- the signed compare in the shifted
 * domain, so the asr folds away) and again at the bottom of every iteration,
 * which is what `volatile` buys.
 *
 * The cast goes on the ELEMENT, not on the array: `((Func)g[i])()` puts
 * gUnknown_03002FA0's address in the loop preheader and gUnknown_030030E8's
 * first in the pool, exactly as the ROM has it. Casting the array instead --
 * `((Func *)g)[i]()` -- creates that pseudo before the guard, swaps the two
 * pool words and pushes gUnknown_030030E8's address into a -fforce-addr
 * .rodata word reached through one extra `ldr`. */
