 *
 * The ldrsh is the whole signedness argument -- see the note on unk832 in
 * unknown-globals.h. The ldrh beside it is the += 8 reading the same word.
 *
 * gUnknown_084C30F8 is fetched again for the return because the strh may alias
 * the pointer itself. Both fetches go through a .rodata address-constant word
 * (-fforce-addr), which is why the ROM shows a double ldr and a
 * gUnknown_0812A154 pool symbol; that word holds &gUnknown_084C30F8 and the
 * split build places it. */
