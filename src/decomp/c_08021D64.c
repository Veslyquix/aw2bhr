/* UNPARKED, wave 32 (W32-A). Wave 31 left this at 91.7%: the ROM groups the
 * VRAM base with the `(n & 1) << 12` term (`adds r2, r2, r0; adds r1, r1, r2`)
 * and every candidate grouped it with the chr_block term instead.
 *
 * THE LEVER IS WHICH TERM CARRIES THE POINTER CAST, not parenthesisation and
 * not a temporary -- wave 31 had ruled out all three orderings, explicit
 * parentheses, an `int off` local and a `u8 *dst` local, and it was right that
 * none of them works. agbcc's `associate_trees` rewrites `(X + C) + Y` as
 * `X + (Y + C)`: the integer constant migrates to the term that is NOT the
 * pointer. So casting the CHR_BLOCK term to `u8 *` and writing the constant
 * next to it drives the constant onto the `(n & 1)` term, which is where the
 * ROM has it -- and it fixes the evaluation order at the same time, because the
 * pointer term is evaluated first.
 *
 * Wave 31 tried this shape with the casts the other way round
 * (`(u8 *)(0x06002000 + ((n & 1) << 12)) + chr`), which is the same rule
 * pushing the constant the wrong way. */
