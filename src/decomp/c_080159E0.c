 * clear it, point gUnknown_03001FBC at the slot, call the slot's +0x08
 * callback if it has one, and step the script.
 *
 * The mask is the literal 0xfffe and not `~1`: `~1` is -2, which agbcc
 * materialises as `movs r0,#2; rsbs r0,r0,#0` rather than the pool word the
 * ROM has.
 *
 * ->unk08 is reached as `(base + 8) + index*0x60` rather than off the `&g[a]`
 * register that is already live -- the offset-hoisted-onto-the-base shape the
 * flat `g[i].m` spelling produces, which the struct's own note in
 * unknown-globals.h records for the same members. Binding `&g[a]` to a local
 * pointer folds the 8 into the load displacement instead.
