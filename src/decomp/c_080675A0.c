/* Tear-down: whites out the whole 512-entry palette, re-enables all four
 * backgrounds and forced blank, and then either restarts this proc's script at
 * label 0 or breaks it, on the +0x64 flag.
 *
 * +0x64 is the same result flag src/decomp/c_08067554.c's sub_08067564 SETS to
 * 1 when A or START dismisses the message, so this is the far end of that pair.
 * It is read `ldrsh` here where that file declares it u16; the field only ever
 * holds 0 or 1, so the two spellings are byte-neutral for both functions and I
 * have left that file alone -- s16 here is what this function's own load
 * proves, and nothing yet discriminates.
 *
 * The palette loop descends: the ROM's giv init is `gPal + 0x3FE` stepping
 * `subs r0, #2`, which an ascending source cannot produce -- check_dbra_loop
 * reverses the COUNTER, not the pointer. 0x1ff, 0x7fff and 0x3fe are all pool
 * words because none fits an imm8.
 *
 * The four DISPCNT bg bits are one `ldrb` / four `orr` / one `strb` on byte 1,
 * and forced_blank a separate pair on byte 0: agbcc CSEs consecutive bitfield
 * writes that land in the same byte, exactly as in the matched
 * src/decomp/c_0802E960.c. */
