/* Family F011: `push {lr}; bl f; ldr r0,=g; movs r1,#N; bl h; pop {r0}; bx r0`.
 * Two statements and NOT a nest -- r0 is overwritten by the pool `ldr` between
 * the two calls, so nothing can survive from the first one. `pop {r0}` is the
 * void epilogue.
 *
 * THE ONE MEMBER OF THE FAMILY THAT TAKES A PARAMETER, and the tell is
 * entirely on the callee side: r0 is not written before `bl sub_0801B780`, and
 * sub_0801B780 reads it (`adds r4, r0, #0; adds r0, #0x28`). A forwarded
 * parameter costs zero instructions, so the alternative -- `sub_0801B780(0)`
 * -- is what would have been visible, as a `movs r0, #0` ahead of the call.
 * `int` and not a narrow type: there is no shift pair anywhere in the body. */
