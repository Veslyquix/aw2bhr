/* Move the cursor to the object's cell, then derive a duration from unk24:
 * a sixteenth of it, clamped to 0x32 above and floored at 1.
 *
 * The two stores of unk2c are cross-jumped -- the 0x32 arm branches straight
 * into the `str` at the bottom of the else arm -- which is why the `b` lands
 * between the `asrs` and the zero test rather than at the end.
 *
 * `asrs r1, #4` and a `cmp` against 0x3E7 with no narrowing make unk24 a signed
 * word. The struct is local to this file rather than `struct Unk03001470`: the
 * offsets line up, but that type has u16 at +0x24 and +0x26, and this function
 * reads +0x24 with a full-word `ldr`. Recorded rather than reconciled. */
