 * The `lsls r0, r0, #0x18` between the `bl` and the `cmp` is the whole type
 * signal here: sub_0803CAF0 is one of the gUnknown_02028030 single-bit readers
 * and its declared return type is eight bits wide, so testing the result
 * re-narrows it. An `int` return emits no such shift.
 *
 * Branch polarity: the `bne` jumps to the -1 block and the fallthrough is 1,
 * which is the `if (C) return A; return B;` layout with A = -1. Writing the
 * inverse (`if (!f(id)) return 1; return -1;`) swaps the two blocks and misses.
