/* Sibling of sub_08071DB4 -- the same window/blend opening, but it zeroes
 * BLDY instead of setting it to 0x10, commits only the target1 half of the
 * layer mask, and seeds the proc accumulator with 0 rather than 0x100.
 * One fewer masked insert is the whole 16-byte difference.
 *
 * The `*(u16 *)&` cast on gUnknown_030030E0 is load-bearing for the same
 * reason as in sub_08071DB4: spelling it `.raw` keeps the 0 alive in its own
 * callee-saved pseudo (r5 instead of the r3 the ROM rematerialises at the
 * store), which costs the extra `push {r5}`. Size stays 124 either way, so
 * this one is a pure allocation difference and a size check would miss it. */
