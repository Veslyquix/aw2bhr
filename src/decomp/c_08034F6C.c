/* Promoted from assembly; each function below is byte-for-byte

 * contiguous block at 0x08034F6C.
 * GetMapLock @ 0x08034F6C, IncrementMapLock @ 0x08034F7C
 *
 * Not a Xenesis-documented name. gGameLock.map is a lock DEPTH rather than a
 * flag -- read here, bumped here, decremented with a floor at zero by
 * DecrementMapLock and cleared outright by RemoveMapLock -- so this trio plus
 * RemoveMapLock is the map half of the lock set in include/lock.h. The old
 * sub_XXXXXXXX symbols are kept as linker aliases below so every other unit
 * keeps resolving them unchanged.
