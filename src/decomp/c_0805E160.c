/* Wave 52, W52-D.  MATCHED (332/332, relocs resolve to the same addresses).
 *
 * gUnknown_0816DA5C / _0816DA60 / _0816DA64 are NOT globals -- the ROM words
 * there hold 0x08499590, 0x030040D8 and 0x030013EC, so they are agbcc's own
 * -fforce-addr constants for gUnknown_08499590, gUnknown_030040D8 and
 * gUnknown_030013EC.  The honest spelling reproduces all three and the
 * promotion must carry the three rodata words:
 *   "rodata": ["0x0816DA5C", "0x0816DA60", "0x0816DA64"]
 *
 * THE LOOP IS A GOTO LOOP, and that is the whole residual.  Written as a
 * `do { } while (r != 1)` the shape is otherwise byte-exact but LICM builds a
 * preheader out of three invariants -- the pooled 0x270F, `add rN,sp,#4` and
 * gUnknown_03004730's base -- which costs a third high callee-saved register
 * (the ROM pushes only r6/r7 for r8/sb) and pushes gUnknown_030013EC's
 * -fforce-addr pointer out of r5.  A goto loop has no NOTE_INSN_LOOP_BEG, LICM
 * never runs, and all of it comes back at once.  This is exactly the
 * measurement recorded on sub_0805B778 (wave 51, W51-E), which is this
 * function's twin: same scratch cell, same 0x270F seed, same
 * gUnknown_03003340 / sub_08058224 / sub_080591E4 tail.
 *
 * _call_via_r4 here is a FIVE-argument indirect call, not a four-argument one:
 * r4 is callee-saved, so the register index is not an arity readout (W46-D).
 *
 * The `(x & 0xc0) != 0` arm is written as the ELSE so that sub_0805B3F4 lands
 * after the body; an early `return` puts that block before the body instead.
 *
 * struct Unk5A514Cell is repeated here rather than declared in a shared header
 * because src/decomp/c_0805A268.c, c_0805A514.c and c_0805A744.c all define it
 * file-locally; sub_0805A514's promoted definition takes it, so the cast on
 * gUnknown_03003F20 is what keeps this unit in agreement with that definition.
 * See the note at sub_0805A5E0 in include/unknown-functions.h.
 *
 * Uses `gMap` (include/map.h) for the +0x12/+0x417A reads, but the
 * `sub_0801F92C` setup call must pass `gMap->move` (the plane's own array
 * member, decays to `u8 *`), not `gUnknown_08499590 + 0x2852` or a cast --
 * agbcc's CSE only reuses a pointer load across identical symbols, so mixing
 * in the raw name anywhere forces a second pool load and breaks the match
 * (see sub_08057D90 for the fuller writeup of this). */
