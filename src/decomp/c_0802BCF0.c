 *
 * The exit MUST be spelled `return`, not `break`. With `break` agbcc rotates the
 * loop: the `x -= 7` moves to the top behind an entry `b`, x is forced into a
 * high register and y follows it, and the function grows a third callee-saved

 * entry and the +0/+1 that swaps the left and right tiles of each pair, which is
 * why it appears twice in every value.
 *
 * `p[1]` MUST be spelled `base - (u16)(w - 1)`. Without the cast, fold's
 * split_tree pulls the constant out of `w - 1` and re-associates the whole thing

 * the value is only ever stored with `strh`, so combine drops the shift pair.

 * The four values are written INSIDE the loop and hoisted by LICM, not written
 * above it: the ROM's `movs r4, #0` (the `for` init) comes BEFORE all four,
