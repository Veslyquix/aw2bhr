 * gpKeySt->held is NAMED TWICE rather than bound to a local. CSE collapses the
 * two reads to the single `ldrh r1,[r0,#4]` the ROM has either way, but the
 * liveness differs: with a local the value is dead after the second mask and
 * agbcc reuses its register as the AND's destination (`ands r1,r0`), where the
 * ROM keeps the mask in the constant's register (`ands r0,r1`). Worth 2 bytes,
 * and the only difference between 99.0% and the match.
 *
 * The A-branch reads gUnknown_030033E4's two halves as u8 for sub_08034534's
 * declared u8 third and fourth parameters (`ldrb`), while the B-branch reads
 * the same two as s16 for sub_08029088 (`ldrsh`) -- the widths come from the
 * callees, not from the object, exactly as in the matched sub_08041E48. */
