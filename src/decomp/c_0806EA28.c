 * layers plus blending inside it, with BG0 masked out of the second shadow.
 *
 * The three saved high registers are NOT a loop signal -- they hold the
 * constants. Every field here is a distinct one-bit `orr`, and agbcc CSEs
 * 1 / 2 / 4 / 8 / 0x10 / 0x20 into registers because each is used more than
 * once; 0x20 (sb) is live from the DISPCNT store at the top all the way to
 * the win1 blend bit at the bottom, which is what forces the r8/sb/sl spill.
 *
 * The two gUnknown_030030A4 stores are one statement run apart: agbcc keeps
 * the accumulated byte in r1 across the whole gUnknown_030030DC sequence and
 * only stores it after, because the two shadows are distinct objects and
 * neither is volatile. Source order is exactly as written below --
 * the `.bits.win0_enable_blend = 1` really does come after the second
