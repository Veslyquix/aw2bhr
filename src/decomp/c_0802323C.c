/* Two s16 OUT parameters on the stack, which is the only reason this function
 * has an 8-byte frame: `add r3, sp, #4` is the first and
 * `mov r5, sp; adds r5, #6; str r5, [sp]` is the second going in as
 * sub_080230DC's fifth argument. Both come back with `ldrsh`.
 *
 * The third parameter is `int` -- `adds r4, r2, #0` followed by a SEPARATE
 * `lsls #0x10; asrs #0x10` is the copy-then-narrow tell -- but BOTH calls get
 * the narrowed value, not the raw one. sub_080230DC's third parameter is
 * declared s16 and supplies that conversion; sub_08043418's third is declared
 * `int` by its own promoted definition (src/decomp/c_08043418.c), so the cast
 * has to be written here. Without it the ROM's `adds r2, r4, #0` at the second
 * call becomes a reload of the raw parameter and the register assignment for
 * the whole function shifts with it. */
