/* Starts the gUnknown_0849BB50 proc unless one is already running, and seeds it
 * with the same `a * 32 + 0x2e` that the promoted sub_080338C0 writes to +0x38
 * of the very same proc -- so the two agree on both the expression and the
 * field.
 *
 * The Proc_Find result is STORED at +0x58, not merely tested: the ROM's
 * `str r5, [r0, #0x58]` reuses the register holding it rather than
 * materialising a zero, and a literal `= 0` compiles to `movs r0,#0; str` and
 * one fewer pushed register. It is null on this path by construction.
 *
 * The script is bound to a NAMED local, and that is what fixes the register
 * allocation: declared this way the address takes r4 and the Proc_Find result
 * r5, which is the ROM's assignment. With the address left as an -fforce-addr
 * temporary the two swap and every instruction that names them differs. */
