/* Arms a transfer on the link record, or resets it if the record is busy or

 * Two things here are not what the listing looks like.
 *
 * The switch is `switch (a5)` over cases -4..4, NOT `switch ((s8)a5 + 4)`.
 * expand_case builds the tree `index - minval` in the INDEX's own type, so the
 * `+ 4` happens in QImode and comes out as `(a5 << 24) + 0x04000000` shifted
 * back down -- which is why `a5 << 24` and not `(s8)a5` is what stays live in
 * r2, and why each arm re-`asrs` it.
 *
 * The failure block sits BETWEEN the range check and the success block, which
 * an `if (...) { ...; return; }` tail cannot produce -- gcc places the outer
 * if's false-label after the body, so the success block would come first. The
 * forward `goto` is what puts the false-label in the middle.
 *
 * `~0x7E` really is ~0x7E (bits 0 and 7 of the packed byte): `movs #0x7f;
 * rsbs #0` materialises -0x7F. Spelling it 0x81 would have been one `movs`. */
