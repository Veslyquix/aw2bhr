/* Wave 52, W52-B.  MATCHED (permuter, 159 iterations, from a 95.5% hand draft).
 *
 * Two spellings carry the whole thing, both measured -- see the wave-52
 * chapters in docs/agbcc-codegen.md:
 *  - The fill loops MUST use the flat `a2 * 0x6c + i * 2 + (char *)symbol`
 *    form, not `gUnknown_02029816[a2][i]`.  The subscript form creates the
 *    symbol's pseudo FIRST, so LICM emits its `ldr` before the `muls` in both
 *    preheaders; the ROM has it after.  Worth 12 bytes over two preheaders.
 *  - The `+=` target keeps the MEMBER form.  gUnknown_02029816 IS
 *    gUnknown_02029808 + 0xe (wave 48, W48-G), but the ROM carries a second
 *    pool word for gUnknown_02029808 and derives the row with a runtime
 *    `adds r2,#0xe` -- cse.c's use_related_value.  Writing that flat as
 *    `(char *)gUnknown_02029808 + 0xe` FOLDS the constant into the pool word
 *    (`.word gUnknown_02029808+0xe`) and is wrong.
 *  - `new_var` is the permuter's contribution: binding `(u16)(i - 1)` to its
 *    own local is what moves the tail's `ldr` off the top of the block.
 *
 * NOT a twin of sub_08056638 despite adjacency and a shared exemplar: 64
 * instructions against 70, wholly different bodies.  What they share is the
 * 0x6c record, already fully described in include/unknown-globals.h.
