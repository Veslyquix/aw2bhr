 * gUnknown_0200CC2C is its argument; naming the latter honestly gives the two
 * `ldr r0,[r0]` -- the outer one is agbcc's own -fforce-addr word, the ROM
 * word at 0x0808EF58.
 *
 * `return 1` sits at the BOTTOM with the body nested in the `if`, not as an
 * early `if (id == 0) return 1;`. That is not cosmetic: the early form emits
 * the `movs r0,#1` inline after the guard, the nested form emits it past the
 * literal pools as the ROM does. */
