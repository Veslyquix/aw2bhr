/* Builds the four OAM affine terms for gUnknown_0200F720[a] out of the
 * sub_0801BA4C / sub_0801BAA8 sine and cosine pair and the record's own two
 * scale halfwords: pa = cos*4/sx, pb = -(sin*4)/sy, pc = sin*4/sx,
 * pd = cos*4/sy. The four `__divsi3` calls are the whole 160 bytes.
 *
 * `* 4` and not `<< 2`: the callees return s16, so combine folds the call-site
 * re-narrowing and the scale into one `lsls #0x10; asrs #0xe`, which a shift
 * would not reach.
 *
 * ONE `s16 *` over the record, not three `*(s16 *)&...unk0X` casts. The three
 * reads are `movs rI,#k; ldrsh r0,[r4,rI]` off a SINGLE base -- Thumb has no
 * immediate-offset `ldrsh`, so k is the offset register. Writing each member's
 * address separately makes three address pseudos instead of one, costs sl and
 * r7 and measured +24 bytes.
 *
 * They are read `ldrsh` and not `ldrh; lsls #0x10; asrs #0x10`, so unk00,
 * unk02 and unk04 are SIGNED objects. This is the first function to read any of
 * them -- struct Unk0200F720 types all three `u16` on store width alone and
 * says the signs are unproved -- but the struct is left alone and the sign
 * taken through the pointer, which emits nothing. */
