#include "proc.h"
/* One of the two arms of sub_08041958. Resolves the entry's tile position with
 * sub_0803DFE0, starts the 0x0849FBEC proc under the caller's parent, and
 * copies the position, the entry's 4-bit field and its unk04 byte into it,
 * keeping the entry itself at unk4c.
 *
 * `ldrh; lsls #0x16; lsrs #0x1c` is extract_bit_field on the unk02_6 bitfield,
 * not `(unk02 >> 6) & 0xf` on a plain u16 -- the latter gives
 * `lsr #6; movs #0xf; and`, which is longer. include/unknown-globals.h already
 * models unk02 as a 6/4/6 bitfield for exactly this reason.
 *
 * The declaration in include/unknown-functions.h is `void sub_0804074C();`
 * without a prototype, which is compatible with this definition. */
