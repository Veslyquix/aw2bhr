/* Wave 55, W55-C. MATCHED, 604/604 bytes. RE-VERIFIED BY W55-F: trymatch
 * reports "MATCH -- links to identical bytes".
 * Promotion needs "rodata": ["0x0816DAB4", "0x0816DAB8", "0x0816DABC"]
 * (the -fforce-addr words for &gUnknown_085D5ABC, &gUnknown_030040D8 and
 * &gUnknown_08499590), then split_rodata.py + gen_lds.py.
 *
 * W55-F NOTE, because this function is the counter-example to a wave-55
 * mid-wave claim: it was circulated as a 13.7% MISS whose cause was "a local
 * .rodata literal written where the ROM names a global gUnknown_0816DABx". It
 * is neither. 13.7% was a stale score from before W55-C's fix, and the
 * `.rodata` relocations are the CORRECT output of the honest spelling --
 * trymatch resolves them against baserom.gba and prints
 *   "relocs: name different symbols that resolve to the same address ...
 *    The pool word is the same address spelled against a different symbol,
 *    which is a disassembly artefact, not a difference in the ROM."
 * Naming gUnknown_0816DABx as a global would be wrong; see the
 * gUnknown_081D9328 note in include/unknown-globals.h.
 *
 * TWO non-obvious things had to be right, and both were found by reading the
 * LITERAL POOL rather than the byte score:
 *
 * 1. THE OPERAND ORDER OF THE `&`. Writing the guard as
 *      (map->unk3262[...] & gUnknown_085D5ABC[p->unk00].unk1d) == 0
 *    puts gUnknown_08499590's pool word before gUnknown_085D5ABC's; the ROM has
 *    085D5ABC first. Pool words are emitted in order of FIRST REFERENCE, so the
 *    pool order reads out source evaluation order directly. Swapping to
 *      (gUnknown_085D5ABC[p->unk00].unk1d & map->unk3262[...]) == 0
 *    took this function from 13.7% to a match in one attempt -- every one of
 *    those "differing bytes" was the positional shift of `ldr rN,[pc,#X]`.
 *    Note the ROM's `ands r0, r1` leaves the result in the CELL's register even
 *    though the cell is operand 1, so do not try to read operand order off the
 *    destination register -- read it off the pool.
 *
 * 2. THE `v = 0` ARM IS THE ELSE. agbcc emits `if (c) X else Y` as
 *    jump-if-false-to-Y with X inline, so the ROM's `beq <block after the
 *    pool>` with the scoring arm inline means the source condition is the
 *    inverted one: `if (unk00 == 0 || tbl->unk1a != 0x10) v = <score>; else
 *    v = 0;`. The natural `&&` spelling with `v = 0` first is the same length,
 *    so this is invisible in a byte percentage.
 *
 * Also settled:
 *  - gUnknown_03003340's element is read two ways in one function:
 *    `((s8 *)g[y])[x]` (ldrsb) in the first scan, `(s8)g[y][x]` (ldrb +
 *    lsls/asrs) for the `best` store and throughout the second scan.
 *  - the second scan is sub_0805F7B8's scoring idiom (W53-E):
 *    gUnknown_085D584C[terrain & 0x1f].unk00 * 10, compared signed.
