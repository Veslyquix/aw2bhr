 * `(p - gUnits) >> 6` is the matched sub_0804203C's army idiom --
 * exact division by the 0x0c stride (`mul 0x55555555; neg; asr #2`) with the
 * `>> 6` merged into the single `asr #8`. The `+ 1` then indexes
 * gPlayers ONE-BASED, which is what puts the member at a runtime
 * 0x3c + 0x2d == 0x69: exactly the reach struct PlayerStruct's own unk2a note
 * records for sub_08026F9C/sub_08026FD0, which read element [n + 1] the same
 * way.
 *
 * The last test is written `<= ... return 0` and NOT `> ... return 1`. Both are
 * the same predicate, but only this polarity leaves `return 1` inline ahead of
 * the literal pool with `return 0` after it; the other spelling swaps the two
 * blocks. Same lever c_0804203C.c documents for its own pair of returns. */
