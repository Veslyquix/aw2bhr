/* Family F035, exemplar src/decomp/c_0803B6E8.c. Same shape -- save the

 * starter is sub_080152EC rather than Proc_Start, the second argument is a
 * literal 0 rather than PROC_TREE_3, and the store lands at +0x18.
 *
 * The exemplar declares its own `struct UnkB6E8Proc` because Proc_Start returns
 * a bare ProcPtr and nothing else describes that object. Here the opposite
 * holds: sub_080152EC is prototyped `struct Unk03001470 *sub_080152EC(const
 * void *, u8)`, that struct IS declared in include/unknown-globals.h, and +0x18
 * fell inside its filler_15 -- so the right move is to narrow the filler in the
 * header (the "adding a field is normal" case), not to invent a local type that
 * would implicitly deny sub_080152EC's declared return type. */
