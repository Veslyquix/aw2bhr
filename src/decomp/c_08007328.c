/* A modular decrement over a ring whose size is 10 or 8 depending on the s8
 * flag at +7.  `n - 1` is bound to a local rather than folded into the sum:
 * the ROM computes it into its own register (`subs r1, r3, #1`) BEFORE the
 * `ldrsh`, whereas `unk3a + n - 1` associates as `(unk3a + n) - 1` and emits
 * the subtraction after the load.
 *
 * `pop {r1}` says the function returns a value, and r0 already holds the
 * stored halfword, so the return costs nothing. */
