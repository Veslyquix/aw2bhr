 * it. The two produce the same instruction stream -- cross-jumping merges the
 * duplicate into one block and lays case 1 out first, which is why the ROM
 * looks like a fallthrough -- but they allocate differently: written as a
 * fallthrough, a1 keeps r0 and a4 keeps its incoming r3, where the ROM narrows
 * a1 straight into r4 and a4 into r1 and copies a1 to r0 at each call. Same
 * size either way; only the register assignment discriminates. */
