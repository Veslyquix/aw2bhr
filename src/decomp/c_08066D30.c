/* The twin of sub_0806DDF4 over the other gUnknown_08580934 wrapper slot, and
 * it wants the same four things:
 *
 *   - `const` on the wrapper, so loop-invariant motion can hoist its load into
 *     the preheader while the RAM `->unk00` behind it still reloads every
 *     iteration;
 *   - the address taken into `pp`, so the symbol is named on only one side of
 *     the loop -- naming it on both routes it through a synthesised .rodata
 *     word under -fforce-addr and the pool relocation stops matching;
 *   - `i = 0` split out of the `for`, which is what keeps it ahead of the
 *     preheader's address load;
 *   - the `do { } while (0)` around the body, which is NOT decoration. Without
 *     it the cursor and the hoisted zero come out with r3 and r4 swapped, and
 *     that is the whole 4-byte difference. A plain nested block does not do it
 *     and neither does binding the element address instead; the degenerate loop
 *     is what moves the tie-break. Written the way the macro it plainly came
 *     from would expand.
