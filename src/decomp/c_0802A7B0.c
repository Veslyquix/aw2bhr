/* F002, but the callee is sub_080152C0 and NOT sub_080152EC -- the family is

 * The `(s32)` cast is the price of the declared `void sub_080152C0(s32, u8)`:
 * src/proc.c's ProcCmd_19_0801D214 already passes it `(s32)dataPtr`, so the
 * declaration is what the tree agrees on. It is byte-neutral (the pool word is
 * `ldr r0,=gUnknown_0849A1C0` either way) but it is almost certainly the wrong MODEL --
 * sub_080152C0 is the structural twin of sub_080152EC (both allocate a
 * gUnknown_03001470 slot then forward the untouched r0), every argument the
 * ROM hands it is a script blob symbol, and the same blobs are stopped by
 * sub_0801537C(const void *). Retyping it `const void *` needs one edit to
 * proc.c and a rebuild of that file to verify, which is why it was not done
 * here. */
