/* MATCHED (wave 55, W55-D). 384 bytes, relocs match.
 *
 * The twenty-row unit-info table builder. `a1` really is unused -- the header's
 * note on the prototype is right, the prologue is `mov sb, r1` with r0 written
 * before it is ever read, and an unused leading parameter costs no
 * instructions.
 *
 * TWO THINGS DECIDED THIS, both worth carrying forward:
 *
 * 1. THE TABLE SELECTION MUST BE ITS OWN STATEMENT. Written inline as
 *    `t = (IsNeotanksUnlocked(a2) ? A : B)[i];` agbcc evaluates the SUBSCRIPT first
 *    and hoists `i * 2` into a callee-saved register ahead of the `bl`, then
 *    adds the selected base afterwards. The ROM does the opposite: the call and
 *    the `?:` run first, the pointer lands in r1, and only then is `i * 2`
 *    computed. Splitting it into
 *        p = IsNeotanksUnlocked(a2) ? A : B;
 *        t = p[i];
 *    puts the two in the ROM's order and took the function from 91.9% (31 of
 *    384 bytes, size already exact) to a match. Nothing else changed, and the
 *    r1/r2 swap in the `movs #54; mov sl` pair three instructions later fixed
 *    itself -- it was downstream of this, not a second defect.
 *
 * 2. `DivRem(i, 4)` is recomputed at all four use sites and `(i >> 2) * 0x18`
 *    is written inline at all four as well; agbcc CSEs the shift into r7 and
 *    parks the shared 0x36 in sl by itself. Do not bind either to a local.
 *
 * `asrs r2, r1, #2` is `i >> 2`, not `i / 4`: a signed division by 4 would
 * carry the round-toward-zero fixup, and there is none.
 *
 * The two id tables are newly declared in include/unknown-globals.h; the two
 * callees sub_080859A0 / GetFirepowerIcon (and sub_08085638 / sub_080856A0) were
 * already promoted and matching in src/decomp but had never been declared,
 * because this function was their only caller and it was still asm. The
 * declarations added to include/unknown-functions.h copy the promoted
 * definitions exactly.
