 * The third argument is the OAM blob gUnknown_0848B6D6 named DIRECTLY. There is
 * no pointer global here: agbcc -fforce-addr parks `&gUnknown_0848B6D6` in this
 * unit's own .rodata, and that word is what the splitter named
 * gUnknown_08090EEC (0x08090EEC holds 0x0848B6D6). Declaring gUnknown_08090EEC
 * as a `void *` global and dereferencing it costs a third load and +12 bytes;
 * binding its address to a local kills the extra load but makes agbcc
 * precompute the argument before the DivRem call, which spends another
 * callee-saved register. An array name is an address constant, so it is neither
 * precomputed nor double-loaded -- that is what puts the load in the ROM's
 * position, after the call and straight into r2.
 *
 * `(u16)(a2 & 0xff)` keeps its cast: sub_0801BD00's second parameter is `s32`,
 * so without it the value is a plain int and LICM hoists the whole thing. With
 * it, only the invariant `<< 16` hoists and the `>> 16` stays at the call,
 * which is the ROM's `lsls r7, r0, #0x10` / `lsrs r1, r7, #0x10` pair. */
