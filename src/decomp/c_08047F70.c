/* MATCHED (wave 77, W77-I), by decomp-permuter. Was parked at 98.8% since
 * wave 36 on SIX bytes -- three instances of one instruction, `mov r1, r8`
 * emitted as `mov r3, r8`:
 *
 *   ROM        mov r1, r8 / ldr r0,[r1] / ldr r0,[r0] / ldrh r1,[r0, #2]
 *   candidate  mov r3, r8 / ldr r0,[r3] / ldr r0,[r0] / ldrh r1,[r0, #2]
 *
 * r8 holds the -fforce-addr address constant &gpKeySt for the whole function,
 * read six times, once at the head of each `gpKeySt->` test after the first.
 * Three of the six already used r1; the differing three were the 2nd, 4th and
 * 6th -- a strict alternation, which is a least-recently-used pick inside
 * reload with no operand, order or shape component the source can name
 * directly. Wave 36 spent four hand attempts on it and correctly concluded
 * that this is the one documented case for the permuter rather than a fifth
 * spelling.
 *
 * THE WHOLE FIX IS THE `(v = p->unk1f)` BINDING IN THE FIRST ARM'S CONDITION.
 * The assignment is dead -- `v` is overwritten in the 0x80 arm before it is
 * ever read -- and it emits no instruction. What it does is extend `v`'s live
 * range across the first arm, which changes the pressure reload sees at each
 * of the six r8 reads and flips the alternating pick onto r1 throughout. This
 * is the same lever W77-C recorded (a narrow binding in an `if` condition is a
 * register lever, and the permuter is what finds it); it is not something a
 * hand rewrite was ever likely to reach, because the binding is semantically
 * pointless and only its live range matters.
 *
 * DO NOT "TIDY" THAT BINDING OUT. It looks like an artefact and it is the
 * match. Re-run trymatch after any edit here, cosmetic ones included -- the
 * body below is the permuter's result with whitespace and brace style restored
 * to the file's own conventions and nothing else changed (re-verified: exit 0).
 *
 * WHAT WAS FIXED BY HAND ON THE WAY, all measured in wave 36 and still load-
 * bearing:
 *  - The 0x200 arm's if/else is written with the `<= 5` (zero) arm FIRST. The
 *    ROM branches `bgt` past the fall-through to the `-6` arm, which is what
 *    gcc emits when the arm reached by FALLING THROUGH is the one written
 *    first. Writing it `> 5` first swapped both arms in the output.
 *  - The 0x80 arm's else needs `v = p->unk20 + 1;` bound to its own local.
 *    Written inline as `p->unk1f - (p->unk20 + 1) > 4`, fold reassociates it
 *    to `(p->unk1f - 1) - p->unk20` and emits `subs r0, r5, #1`, where the ROM
 *    materialises `unk20 + 1` once and STORES that same register.
 *  - `limit` (0x80 arm) and `d` (0x200 and 0x100 arms) must be ONE s16 local,
 *    not two. As two locals the whole function's callee-saved assignment
 *    shifted by one and twelve further instructions differed.
 *  - Local declaration order is byte-neutral (measured, wave 36).
 *
 * TOOLING NOTE: `python tools/permute.py sub_08047F70` aborts at setup with
 * `conflicting types for 'sub_08047F70'`. It seeds from best.c by default, and
 * this function's best.c is an older hand file lacking the `#define` shadow
 * above, so after cpp the unit carries two conflicting declarations. Run it as
 * `python tools/permute.py sub_08047F70 --current` to seed from this file.
 *
 * gUnknown_0812A13C is the -fforce-addr word holding &gpKeySt (dereferenced in
 * baserom.gba: 0x0812A13C -> 0x03002EE0, and aw2bhr.lds puts gpKeySt exactly
 * there). Do NOT reintroduce a `gUnknown_0812A13C` object.
 *
 * ON PROMOTION this function needs:  "rodata": ["0x0812A13C"]
