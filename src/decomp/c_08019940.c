 *
 * gPlayers is a POINTER global, so the ROM's two `ldr`s are the
 * `-fforce-addr` `.rodata` word (0x0808E5B4, which holds 0x08499598) followed
 * by the pointer load; both stay INSIDE the loop because the calls in the body
 * may repoint it. `a`'s element offset (`a * 0x3c`, as `(a << 4) - a << 2`) is
 * the only thing LICM hoists.
 *
 * `i` is `u8`: the ROM re-truncates it `lsls #0x18; lsrs #0x18` at the bottom
 * and the bound is `cmp #4; bls`, an unsigned test. The `&&` really is one --
 * both halves branch to the same skip label and the second is a call, so
 * there is no arm to invert. */
