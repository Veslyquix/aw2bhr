/* gUnknown_085D6A48's 24-byte rows are STRUCTS, not `u16[12]`: the column-1
 * offset stays in the `ldrh` displacement instead of being reassociated onto
 * the base.  See the "column-offset fold" chapter of docs/agbcc-codegen.md.
 * The global keeps its `u16 [][12]` declaration (wave 17 recorded why), so the
 * row shape is spelled locally and cast at the use.  The cast has to sit INSIDE
 * the loop: written before the `for`, the address load lands ahead of `i = 0`
 * in the preheader, and written as one inline expression `-fforce-addr` parks
 * the base in this unit's .rodata and adds an `ldr`. */
