/* A halfword "add a bias into a copy" loop: the same shape as sub_08012B00 two
 * files down, except the destination is a second pointer rather than the source
 * itself. `size` counts BYTES (`subs r2, #2` per halfword) and is signed --
 * `ble`/`bgt`, and the guard is duplicated at the top, so the decrement is the
 * last statement of the body rather than part of the condition.
 * `delta` is u16: the `lsls #16; lsrs #16` ahead of the loop is the fill-loop
 * parameter narrowing, and `adds r0, r3, r0` puts the value's own register
 * first, which is the narrow-parameter operand order sub_08012B00 records. */
