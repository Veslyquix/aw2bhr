 *
 * gUnknown_03001FD0 is declared `u16` and its only other user
 * (src/decomp/c_080123EC.c) just clears it whole, so nothing so far said how
 * wide the object really is. This function BYTE-addresses it at +0 and +1 --
 * two independent `ldrb`/`orrs`/`strb` pairs off one pool word -- which makes
 * the halfword declaration at best incomplete: it is an aggregate of at least
 * two bytes, probably another register shadow given the sub_08012420 flush that
 * follows. The byte-pointer view is the weakest spelling that reproduces the
 * ROM without retyping a global that a matched file already writes; NOT a claim
 * about the real type. Both masks here are SETS, and per docs/agbcc-codegen.md
 * a set is byte-identical for a bitfield and a scalar OR alike, so this
 * function cannot discriminate either. */
