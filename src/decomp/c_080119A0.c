 * draws seven pixels higher, and those do NOT advance the cursor).
 *
 * The `(u8)` on the result is real: sub_0801172C returns `int`, and an `int`
 * truth test compiles to a bare `cmp r0, #0`. The ROM's `lsls r0, r0, #0x18`

/* Prints a value in HEX, least significant nibble first, walking x LEFTWARDS
 * one 8-pixel cell per digit. The digit tiles are 0x3D0..0x3D9 for 0-9 and
 * 0x3E0..0x3E5 for a-f, so the two arms are spelled differently in the source:
 * `d | 0x3D0` for the decimal digits (an OR that agbcc builds from
 * `movs #0xf4; lsls #2`) and `d + 0x3D6` for the letters (a pooled word).
 *
 * Neither call narrows its third argument even though sub_08011704 takes a
 * u16: combine can see that `(v & 0xF) | 0x3D0` and `(v & 0xF) + 0x3D6` both
 * fit 16 bits, so the zero-extension folds away. sub_08011A20, whose digit
 * comes out of __umodsi3, keeps the shift pair for exactly that reason.
 *
 * The shifted-down remainder is bound to a SECOND local and it is that local,
 * not `v`, that the exit test reads. That is worth 2 bytes and it is the whole
 * difference between this and the obvious `v >>= 4; } while (v != 0);`:
 * testing `t` keeps `t` live across the `v = t` copy, so the two pseudos
 * conflict and the allocator cannot coalesce them -- hence the ROM's
 * `lsrs r0, r5, #4; adds r5, r0, #0` instead of an in-place `lsrs r5, r5, #4`.
 * Six other spellings (`v /= 16`, `while ((v >>= 4) != 0)`, a temp tested
 * through `v`, a `for(;;)`/`break`, a separate local seeded from the
 * parameter) all coalesce and all come out 2 bytes short. */
