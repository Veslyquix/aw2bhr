/* The key-repeat tick. Reads REG_KEYINPUT (active low, hence `0x3FF ^`),
 * publishes the raw state, derives the newly-pressed set, and counts down the
 * repeat timer while the state is unchanged.
 *
 * TWO readings that are not free choices.
 *
 * The `ldr`/`str` pairs between three globals declared `u16` are 32-BIT copies
 * spelled `*(u32 *)&dst = *(u32 *)&src` -- the same scalar-cast idiom
 * src/decomp/c_0806EB5C.c uses on gUnknown_030030E0. A u16-to-u16 assignment
 * would be `ldrh`/`strh`.
 *
 * The `adds r1, r4, #0` in front of `cmp r1, #0` is the whole reason the guard
 * reads gUnknown_03002F04 rather than the local: cse substitutes the value just
 * stored, and the substitution lands in a fresh pseudo, which is that copy. The
 * final store uses the LOCAL and so needs no such copy.
 *
 * gUnknown_0808E524 is not a global -- it is agbcc's `-fforce-addr` word for
 * &gUnknown_03000040 (baserom.gba holds 0x03000040 there), which is why the
 * pool word relocates against .rodata here.
 *
 * PROMOTION NEEDS THE POOL WORD PLACED: this function's data/promoted.json
 * entry needs  "rodata": ["0x0808E524"]  and then tools/split_rodata.py +
 * tools/gen_lds.py before the build. */
