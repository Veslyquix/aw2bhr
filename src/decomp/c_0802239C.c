/* A seven-argument wrapper over the eight-argument sub_0802216C: it folds the
 * (x, y) cell into the tilemap pointer and passes four zeroes for the trailing
 * options.
 *
 * The two coordinate scalings are the shorten_binary_op form -- `lsls #0x10`
 * then `lsrs #0xf` is `(u16)x * 2`, not a mask and a shift -- and they fuse the
 * u16 parameters' entry narrowing with the pointer scale, which is why the
 * halves of each pair sit apart in the listing.
 *
 * Every parameter width below is read off sub_0802216C's own prologue, not
 * guessed here: r1/r3 and the first and last stack arguments narrow to u8, r2
 * and the middle two stack arguments to u16, and r0 is untouched. */
