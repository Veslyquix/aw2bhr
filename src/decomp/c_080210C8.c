/* Dispatches one of three record runs in gMap->visible to sub_08020EDC:
 * cases 1 and 3 select it with gUnknown_03004070, case 2 with
 * gUnknown_03004088 (each run is MAP_POOL_SIZE bytes), and case 3 FALLS
 * THROUGH into case 2 so it issues both.
 *
 * The dispatch tree pivots on 1 (`cmp #1; beq` then `cmp #1; ble`), which three
 * reachable arms cannot produce -- balance_case_nodes puts a three-node tree's
 * root at 2. The fourth node is `case 0:` sharing `default:`, the recipe
 * docs/agbcc-codegen.md records from waves 28 and 29; it is invisible in the
 * branch targets because it shares the end label, so only the TEST COUNT shows
 * it.
 *
 * `(u8)a6` (wave 90, W90-C): sub_08020EDC's 6th parameter is `int`, and
 * this cast is the `lsls #0x18; lsrs #0x18` each call site emits. */
