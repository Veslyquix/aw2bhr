 *
 * The position pair at +0x42/+0x44 is in 1/16ths -- `cmp #0; bge; adds #0xf;
 * asrs #4` is signed division by 16, not a shift -- and sub_08035850 is the
 * producer that stores `arg * 16` into the same two fields.
 *
 * The proc pointer is dereferenced through a cast at each use rather than
 * bound to a local: a `struct Unk35760Proc *proc = procPtr;` local is a second
 * pseudo and costs one extra `adds rN, r0, #0` in the prologue, which the ROM
 * does not have. */
