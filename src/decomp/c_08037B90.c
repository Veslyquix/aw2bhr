/* Recounts the four terrain tallies in gUnknown_02027F74 by walking the map's
 * tile plane and classifying each cell through gUnknown_0849959C, the same
 * tile-id -> terrain byte table c_0801759C.c and c_08021750.c use.
 *
 * gUnknown_03003F68 is declared `void *`; the byte fields at +0/+1 are the
 * width and height, as c_08037CF8.c and c_08086D98.c already read them. The
 * u16 plane at +2 gets a file-local tag so the reference stays a COMPONENT_REF
 * and keeps the ROM's `ldrh [rN, #2]`, the spelling c_0801759C.c records.
 *
 * Two orderings the diff insisted on, and they agree with each other:
 *  - `base = 0` is the FIRST statement. The ROM materialises ONE zero and
 *    reuses it as the store value for all four counters; written after them,
 *    agbcc emits a separate constant.
 *  - The switch arms are emitted in SOURCE order, so unk01 comes first and
 *    unk03 last -- the same unk01/unk00/unk02/unk03 order as the four zero
 *    stores above. Written 6/0xa/0xb/0xe the four bodies come out reversed
 *    and the `case 0xe` test flips from `bne` to `beq`+`b`. */

/* Clears the whole 0x400-entry buffer gUnknown_0849957C points at, then lays a
 * fresh 2x2-metatile grid over it and kicks the consumer.
 *
 * The two clamped extents are `u8` LOCALS, not `int`: the ROM compares them
 * `bls` (unsigned) but shifts them `asrs` (signed). An `int` local gives
 * `ble`+`asrs` and a `u32` local gives `bls`+`lsrs`; only a `u8` -- promoted to
 * int for the shift, but known zero-extended at the compare -- gives the ROM's
 * pairing. Measured with all three side by side.
 *
 * The inner counter steps 16 with bound `((h + 1) >> 1) * 16`, and the stored
 * value uses `j` unscaled. Writing it as a 0..(h+1)/2 counter with `j * 16`
 * inside emits `lsl #5`/`lsl #4` per iteration instead.
 *
 * `j + 1 + i + 0x1000` must keep the 1 and the 0x1000 apart: agbcc's fold only
 * merges a constant with an ADJACENT one, so this spelling hoists 0x1000 into
 * a register (two instructions, no pool word) and leaves `adds #1` inline.
 * Spelled `... + i + 1 + 0x1000` the two fold to 0x1001 and need a pool word.
 *
 * gUnknown_0849957C is reloaded inside the loop because it is a POINTER
 * global, not an array -- do not bind it to a local. */
