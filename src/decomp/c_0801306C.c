/* An on-screen test: the bounds are 0xf0 and 0xa0, i.e. 240x160, widened by
 * half the object's size in both directions.

 * Written as one `||` of four failures rather than four `if (...) return 0;`
 * statements. Both are the same predicate, but the separate-statement form
 * makes agbcc recompute `h + 0xa0` from scratch (`adds r0, r2, #0; adds r0,
 * #0xa0`), where the ROM derives it from the live `h + 0xf0` with
 * `subs r0, #0x50`. The `||` chain keeps that value in one basic block, which
 * is what lets the CSE happen. Measured side by side.
 *
 * The comparisons are spelled with the bound on the LEFT (`h + 0xf0 < x`), not
 * as `x > h + 0xf0` -- the ROM's `cmp r0, r4` has the operands that way round,
 * and swapping them swaps the instruction. `asrs` on the size makes it
 * signed. */
