/* MATCHED, wave 77 (W77-J). Parked at 97.6% from wave 34 to wave 77.
 *
 * The whole 6-byte / three-instruction residual was the DECLARED TYPE OF
 * `cell`. It was `int cell;` holding a value loaded from a u8 array; making
 * it `u8 cell;` -- the honest width of `tiles[off]` -- reproduces the ROM's
 * `ldr r0,=g / movs r1,#0xe0 / ldrh r0,[r0] / ands r3,r1 / cmp r0,r3`
 * exactly, on the first compile. Nothing else in the function changed.
 *
 * Waves 34 and 39 diagnosed the residual correctly as a register assignment
 * (the constant needs r1 so the scheduler can hoist it above `ldrh r0,[r0]`)
 * and then spent five try_match attempts and a 300 s permuter run on
 * SOURCE-EXPRESSION spellings of the comparison -- operand order, binding the
 * mask to a local, `cell &= 0xe0`, `cell & ~0x1f`. None of those can move an
 * allocation, and the notes said so. The lever was one declaration away and
 * was never on the ruled-out list because the type of a local that only ever
 * holds a byte reads as settled.
 *
 * AT PROMOTION this needs its .rodata pool word placed, exactly as
 * sub_080254AC does:  "rodata": ["0x08090A48"]  (agbcc's -fforce-addr word
 * holding &gUnknown_085D5ABC). trymatch reports it as
 * `a8: R_ARM_ABS32 .rodata`; that is the wave-18 honest-spelling flow.
 *
 * Two type findings this function established are in
 * include/unknown-globals.h: struct UnitType.unk58 (a `const u8 *`
 * per-terrain cost table, carved out of filler_52) and gUnknown_084995DA
 * (one ROM terrain code per unit type).
