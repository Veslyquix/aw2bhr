/* A trimmed sub_080155C0 call in the same idiom as c_0804E584.c: the two
 * origin pointers come out of gUnknown_084C3F70 / gUnknown_084C3F78 and the
 * arguments are `pos - *origin` re-narrowed to s16 by the callee's prototype.
 * All four parameters are the header's declared (u16, s16, s16, s16); the four
 * `lsls #0x10; lsrs #0x10` pairs at entry are PROMOTE_MODE and say nothing
 * about signedness.
 *
 * The one lever is the gUnknown_085D6A48 ROW. Both suppression tests read the
 * same 24-byte record, and the ROM holds its ADDRESS in r1 across them
 * (`adds r1, r0, r2` then `ldrh [r1, #8]` / `ldrh [r1, #2]`). Writing the
 * subscript out twice instead keeps the table BASE in a register and adds the
 * member offset to it at each use (`adds r0, r3, #8` / `adds r0, r3, #2`),
 * which is 4 bytes long and puts v in the wrong register. Binding the row to a
 * `u16 *` is what folds the offsets into the load displacements. */
