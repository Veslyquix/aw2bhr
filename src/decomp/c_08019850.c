/* Family F020 (tools/families.py): seven 32-byte leaves that are all
 * `return <slot lookup>(script) != -1;`. The whole body is one `!=` compiled
 * as a VALUE rather than a branch: agbcc's do_store_flag turns `x != 0` into
 * `(x | -x) >> 31`, and the `mvns` in front of it is the `-1` folded into the
 * comparison (`x != -1` is `~x != 0`). The `lsls #N; asrs #N` pair is the
 * callee's declared signed return width re-extended at the call site --
 * `#0x18` for sub_08015BD0's `s8`, `#0x10` for sub_08019290's `s16`.
 * Probed and byte-identical, so none of them is evidence: `bool8` vs `int`
 * return, and an `s8`/`s16` local for the result before the compare. The
 * explicit `if (...) return TRUE; return FALSE;` spelling is NOT -- it emits
 * the branching four-block form from the Control-flow table in
 * docs/agbcc-codegen.md and is four bytes longer.
