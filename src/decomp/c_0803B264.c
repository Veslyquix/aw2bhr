 *
 * gUnknown_03001FBC IS RELOADED at every use -- five `movs rN,#0; ldrsh` off
 * one pool word -- because each call may change it. Passing it as both
 * arguments of ONE sub_080158D4 call makes gcc read it once before the inner
 * call and keep it in a callee-saved register instead, which is two
 * instructions different. Splitting the inner call into its own statement is
 * what restores the reload.
 *
 * `t` is `int`, not `s16`. With `s16` the +0x10 is applied before the shift
 * pair; with `int` the conversion at sub_080158D4's `s16` parameter folds
 * with the callee's own re-narrowing into `lsls #0x10; adds 0x100000;
 * asrs #0x10` -- the ROM's form, and the same instruction count. */
