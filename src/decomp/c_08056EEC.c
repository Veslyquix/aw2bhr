/* Fills a six-halfword record on its own stack and hands the address to
 * sub_08056F8C -- the same shape sub_08057048 hands to sub_080570C4, and the
 * same two ROM tables indexed the same two ways.
 *
 * The second argument is never read; arity 3 comes from the r2 narrowing, and
 * that narrowing is FUSED with the scaling (`lsls #0x10` at entry, `lsrs #0xf`
 * at the use), i.e. `gUnknown_08553864[c]` on a u16 c -- a net left shift of
 * one, not a mask.
 *
 * gUnknown_085D6A48's column 1 is the case sub_08057048 is parked on, and the
 * COMMA-OPERATOR anchor closes it. The ROM wants both the `ldrh [r1, #2]`
 * displacement and the three pool words loaded outermost-first (08553878,
 * 085D6A48, 03004580, with 08553878 in the callee-saved r5 that pays for
 * `push {r4, r5, lr}`). `gUnknown_085D6A48[X][1]` gives the pool order and an
 * extra `adds r3, #2`; the struct cast written in place gives the displacement
 * and loads 085D6A48 LAST; binding the base in a statement of its own gives the
 * displacement but hoists 085D6A48 ahead of 08553878. Creating the pseudo
 * inside the subscript with a comma gives all three.
