/* The map-screen bring-up, entered as a Proc callback: everything it does is
 * keyed off proc->unk1e, which is 0 on a fresh start and non-zero on a resume,
 * and the two `if (a == 0)` blocks are the fresh-start-only halves.
 *
 * gActiveMap is reached TWO ways in one function and that is agbcc,
 * not two source spellings: -fforce-addr parks &gActiveMap in this
 * unit's own pool (0x0808D6EC in the ROM) for the reads inside the loop, while
 * the later statements get an ordinary inline pool word. Likewise 0x0808D6F0 /
 * 0x0808D6F4 hold &sub_08036944 / &sub_080369BC with the THUMB bit set, and
 * 0x0808D6F8 / 0x0808D6FC hold &gUnknown_03003F3C and a script blob at
 * 0x084858AC -- all five are written honestly here and agbcc rebuilds the pool.
 *
 * 0x084858AC has no symbol of its own: data/data.s covers 0x084857AC..0x084858DC
 * as one incbin, so the script is named as an offset into it. */
