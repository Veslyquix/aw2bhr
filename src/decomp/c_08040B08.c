/* Installs the spinning sprite and seeds OAM affine slot 0 with the identity
 * rotation: the four Divs are the standard (cos, -sin, sin, cos) matrix at
 * angle 0, scaled by 16 over 0x100. Writing them as SIN_Q12/COS_Q12 is the
 * honest spelling -- COS_Q12(0) is exactly the `gSinLut + 0x80` the ROM loads
 * (0x80 bytes is 64 halfwords).
 *
 * Div is called FOUR times, not three plus a reuse: the first and last
 * arguments are the same expression, but Div is an ordinary call so nothing
 * CSEs across it. Each result is narrowed `lsls #0x10; asrs #0x10` into
 * SetObjAffine's s16 parameters, and the first three must survive the later
 * calls, which is what puts them in r6/r5/r4 and spills the fourth to the stack
 * as the fifth argument. */
