/* Copies an IWRAM CODE OVERLAY into place: 0x086173F0 in ROM is CpuSet over
 * 0x03005C88 .. 0x0300677C, and three wrappers a few dozen bytes below then
 * call into the copied region through odd (THUMB) addresses inside it. See the
 * gUnknown_03005C88 note in include/unknown-globals.h.
 *
 * The length is a BYTE difference divided by four, and the ROM says so: it
 * carries the `cmp #0; bge; adds #3` rounding correction of a signed divide.
 * Spelled with `u32 *` boundaries the compiler knows the difference is already
 * a word count and drops the correction, which is 4 bytes short.
 *
 * `lsls #9; lsrs #0xb` is that divide FUSED with a mask, counted the way
 * docs/agbcc-codegen.md says to count a shift pair -- `(u32)x << 9 >> 11` keeps
 * bits 2..22, i.e. `(x / 4) & 0x1FFFFF`, and 21 bits is exactly the width of
 * the BIOS length field. The same fusion is already recorded on sub_08012F6C.
 * `movs #0x80; lsls #0x13` is 0x04000000, the 32-bit-transfer bit. */
