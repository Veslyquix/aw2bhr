/* The four `cmp`s against 4, 6, 1, 7 are tested in that order with no table and
 * no sorting, which is a chain of `||` in source order and not a switch.
 *
 * gUnknown_085D6A48's column 3 needs the `struct Unk85D6A48Row *` local, not
 * the nested `gUnknown_085D6A48[X][3]`: the array form emits `adds rB, #6` in
 * place of the ROM's `ldrh r0, [r0, #6]` displacement, while a folded
 * `*(gUnknown_085D6A48[X] + 3)` moves the +6 into the POOL WORD
 * (`.word gUnknown_085D6A48+0x6`) and frees a register, dropping r7 from the
 * push. Binding the base to the local is what gives the displacement AND keeps
 * the bare pool word loaded first. See the note in sub_08056EEC, where the same
 * table needs the comma-operator form of the same anchor.
