/* Promoted from assembly; each function below is byte-for-byte
 * identical to the original. Order is address order and must

 * contiguous block at 0x0801B9C8.
 * sub_0801B9C8 @ 0x0801B9C8
 */

/* One line of the gUnknown_0808EF64 text stream: sub_0801B7C0 resolves the
 * cursor to a slot (-1 when there is none), the slot's 4-byte record supplies
 * an x offset and a byte, and sub_0801BA1C paints with them. The return value
 * is sub_0808B6B0's, i.e. how far the cursor advanced.
 *
 * TWO measured facts hold this together.
 *   (1) `p` must be BOUND BEFORE the call. The base address is live across
 * `bl sub_0801B7C0` in a callee-saved register -- that is the fourth entry in
 * the push list -- and referencing gUnknown_03002B80 only inside the argument
 * list creates the pseudo after the call, giving `push {r4,r5,r6}` and a
 * 4-byte-short function. Read the push list first.
 *   (2) The record array must be a MEMBER of a struct wrapping the whole
 * block, not a `struct Ent *` pointed at 0x03002DD8. Both spell the same
 * layout, but `p->unk258[i]` keeps 0x258 as a runtime add off the bare symbol
 * (`movs r1,#0x96; lsls #2`) with `&g + i*4` CSEd across the two members,
 * where `q[i].m` on a pre-offset pointer folds 0x258 into the pool word and
 * reaches the second member by displacement. The ROM has the first shape.
 *
 * Parameters 3 and 4 are int, not u16 -- see the note in
 * include/unknown-functions.h; the prologue has no PROMOTE_MODE shift pair. */
