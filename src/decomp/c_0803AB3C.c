/* MATCHED, wave 43 (W43-I), first attempt.
 *
 * Walks the byte script gUnknown_084997C8 selects with
 * gUnknown_0849D89C->unk04->unk00 and draws one sub_0803AAC0 row per entry
 * pair. 0x07 terminates; 0x06 is a break that resets the row counter to 4 and
 * advances by ONE byte instead of two.
 *
 * SUB_0803AAC0 TAKES FOUR ARGUMENTS, NOT THREE, and this function is the
 * evidence. unknown-functions.h had `(u8, u8, u8)` since wave 35, whose own
 * note says the arity was read off the argument setup at the call sites -- but
 * sub_0803AB3C was unmatched then and it is the call site that sets r3
 * (`lsls r3,#0x18; asrs r3,#0x18`, an s8 conversion, immediately before the
 * `bl`). Both the prototype and src/decomp/c_0803AAC0.c were given the fourth
 * `s8` parameter; that file is byte-identical after the change (re-verified),
 * because a trailing parameter the body never reads costs no instructions.
 *
 * `e` is `s8` holding 0, 0xd and -1. The ROM materialises -1 as `movs r3,#0xff`
 * and pays the sign extension at the CALL, not at the assignment -- PROMOTE_MODE
 * keeps the pseudo zero-extended and converts at the use.
 *
 * `c` and `d` ARE LOCALS, not `p[i]` / `p[i + 1]` spelled at the call: the ROM
 * loads both at the top of the else-arm, before `e = 0`, and parks `d` in the
 * callee-saved r5 across the whole if/else. Spelled at the call they would load
 * beside the `bl`. The leading `p[i] == 6` test is a SEPARATE read -- the ROM
 * has two `ldrb`s off the same `p + i` -- so `c` is assigned inside the else.
 *
 * `& ~1` and not `& 0xfe`: the ROM builds the mask `movs r0,#2; rsbs r0,r0,#0`,
 * which is the int constant -2. `0xfe` would be a bare `movs r0,#0xfe`. */
