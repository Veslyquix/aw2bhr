/* One of a near-twin pair with sub_0805C9CC: both call sub_0803F5C8(0) for the
 * head of the 8-byte record list at 0x02028360 and walk it until unk02_6 is 0.
 *
 * The 0x3C0 MASK-AND-COMPARE is the bitfield read, not a plain u16 access:
 * comparing struct Unk02028360's `u16 unk02_6 : 4` against a CONSTANT folds to
 * `(container & 0x3C0) == k << 6` in the container's HImode, which is why the
 * mask is hoisted into r3 and compared against 0x40 rather than extracted with
 * a shift pair. sub_0805C9CC's `p->unk02_0` is compared against a VARIABLE, so
 * it cannot fold and comes out as extract_bit_field's `ldrb; lsl #29; lsr #29`
 * instead -- the two spellings in one pair of functions confirm the boundary
 * the header records for this member.
 *
 * The loop test sits at the BOTTOM, entered by `b`, where sub_0805C9CC's is
 * peeled into a guard plus a do/while. That falls out of the compiler, not the
 * source: both are the same `for`, and 0x140 needs a register that 0x40 (an
 * 8-bit `cmp` immediate) does not, so only the twin gets a preheader and with
 * it the rotation. */
