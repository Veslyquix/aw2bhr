 * unk58 is a plain int -- ldr/str, and the strh into gUnknown_03001FFC is the
 * u16 global's own narrowing store, NOT evidence about the field.
 *
 * The assignment is chained rather than split into two statements: the ROM
 * materialises the global's address BEFORE loading the field, which is the
 * order a single assignment expression gives. Writing
 * t = proc->unk58; gUnknown_03001FFC = t; swaps those two ldrs.
 * gUnknown_03001FFC is volatile, so the compare cannot read it back -- the
 * binding local is what keeps the ROM's single ldr of the field. */
