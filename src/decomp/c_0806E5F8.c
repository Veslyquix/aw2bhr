 * arrives in r0 and is kept in r5, while Proc_Find's result goes to r4 and is
 * the only thing written.
 *
 * Both arms of the tail JOIN at the epilogue, so the out-of-line arm is the
 * ELSE: `ble` reaches the increment, making Proc_Break the `if` body and the

 * the same 4 is also the first argument. agbcc CSEs the constant across the two
