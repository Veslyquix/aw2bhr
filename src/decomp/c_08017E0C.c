/* One step of the gUnknown_0200C528[i] script cursor, the same walker
 * src/decomp/c_08017DA0.c drives: publish the node's +0x08 and +0x0c into the
 * global and the slot, advance the cursor, and report whether the step was
 * SKIPPED because gUnknown_03002514 says a transition is running.
 *
 * The `!= 1` polarity is the readout: the ROM's `beq` sends the `== 1` case out
 * of line past the literal pool and runs the publish inline.
 *
 * gUnknown_0808E560 is not a global -- it is agbcc's `-fforce-addr` word for
 * &gUnknown_0200C528 (baserom.gba holds 0x0200C528 there), which is why both
 * pool words relocate against .rodata. The 24-byte stride and the +0x0c
 * halfword are struct Unk0200C528's own.
 *
 * PROMOTION NEEDS THE POOL WORD PLACED: this function's data/promoted.json
 * entry needs  "rodata": ["0x0808E560"]  and then tools/split_rodata.py +
 * tools/gen_lds.py before the build. */
