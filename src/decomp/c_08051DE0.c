/* MATCHED. The representative of the wave-17 shape cluster
 * sub_08051DE0 / sub_080524C0 / sub_0805297C: rebuild the OBJ attributes of
 * the current gUnknown_03001470 slot, then re-place the sprite at a position
 * summed from three tables. The two siblings differ only in an extra
 * `unk28 = 0`, the paletteNum source and the priority constant.
 *
 * Three things in here are not guessable and each was worth a probe round:
 *
 *  - `int tile`, NOT `u16 tile` and not the bare expression. All three spell
 *    the same semantics and all three emit the same `ldrh`, but only the `int`
 *    temp produces the ROM's `ldr r2,=0x3FF; adds r0,r2,#0; ands r1,r0` --
 *    the bare expression and a `u16` temp both drop the register copy and come
 *    out two bytes short. Same discriminator as the matched sub_0804D928,
 *    whose value arrives from arithmetic rather than a load.
 *
 *  - gUnknown_08552D80 and gUnknown_085D7E28 are STRUCT arrays, not `u16
 *    [][14]` / `u16 [][5][4]`. The constant-offset members (unk06, unk04) want
 *    their offset in the `ldrh` immediate; the array spelling folds the same
 *    constant into the symbol's address instead and costs an extra `add` at
 *    each of the two sites. See the note on those two in unknown-globals.h.
 *
 *  - `x` starts from the gUnknown_02029A10 entry, not from the gUnknown_08552D80
 *    row. Writing the table term first reverses the pool order AND the load
 *    order (agbcc expands the addresses in source order and issues the loads in
 *    the opposite one), which shows up as gUnknown_08552D80's pool word landing
 *    ahead of gUnknown_02029A10's. */
