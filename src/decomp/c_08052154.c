/* The wave-17 shape cluster of src/decomp/c_08051DE0.c, two members further
 * on: rebuild the OBJ attributes of the current gUnknown_03001470 slot, then
 * re-place the sprite. Read that file's header before this one -- the `int
 * tile` temp and the struct (not `[][14]`) spelling of gUnknown_08552D80 are
 * both load-bearing here for the same reasons, and neither is guessable.
 *
 * What is new in this member: an extra `unk28 = 0` ahead of the other two slot
 * writes, and a much shorter position sum -- x takes ONE table term and y takes
 * none at all. The term is `gUnknown_08552D80[3]`, a CONSTANT row, which agbcc
 * folds to `adds rB, #0x56` (3 * 0x1c + offsetof unk02) on the base rather than
 * into the relocation; that is the "add on the base" row of the pool-fold table
 * and it is what identifies the row index as a literal 3.
 *
 * The entry term is written FIRST in both sums, and that is a readout, not a
 * style choice: gUnknown_02029A10's pool word lands ahead of gUnknown_08552D80's
 * exactly when the source names it first, because agbcc expands the addresses
 * in source order and issues the loads in the opposite one. */
