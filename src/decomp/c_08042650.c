/* MATCHED (wave 66, W66-B), 532/532 bytes. Separate block-scoped volatile
 * reads of the map pointer keep the two cell-address chains independent;
 * struct Map field access for the row table and the terrain/unk234A planes
 * preserves `(map + field) + index`. Binding `&gUnknown_030040D8`, then its
 * pointee, emits both pointer loads before `n << 3` and retains the outer
 * pointer for the ROM's later reload. Promotion needs .rodata words
 * 0x08091354, 0x08091358 and 0x0809135C.
 *
 * SETTLED HERE, and none of it should be re-derived:
 *   - gUnknown_030040D8->unk04 is a 7-BIT BITFIELD. sub_08042650 reads it
 *     twice off ONE `ldrb` with two different extractions -- `movs r0,#0x7f;
 *     ands r0,r3` where it is only tested against zero, and `lsls r0,r3,#0x19;
 *     lsrs r0,r0,#0x19` where the value is used. No plain-u8 spelling gives
 *     both (fold() collapses `((u32)x << 25) >> 25` to the AND at both sites,
 *     because it runs before bitfield extraction is expanded). Declared in
 *     include/unknown-globals.h; the exact 532-byte size and the matching
 *     `ldrb r0,[r0,#5]` confirm the layout is unchanged.
 *   - the `<< 25 >> 25` / `* 0x55555555` / `rsbs` / `asrs` chain is an
 *     EXACT_DIV of a pointer difference, not a magic-number division:
 *     `(struct Unit *)gUnknown_030040D8 - gUnits`. gcc 2.x's
 *     expand_divmod multiplies by invert_mod2n(d >> post_shift) and shifts
 *     AFTERWARDS, so post_shift = 2 for the 12-byte record, and the extra
 *     6 in `asrs #8` is the caller's own `>> 6`. Both spellings appear here:
 *     `((p - base) & 0xc0) >> 6` (asrs #2, mask, asrs #6) and `(p - base) >> 6`
 *     (asrs #8), exactly as src/decomp/c_0802966C.c already had them.
 *   - four callees were promoted but undeclared and are now in
 *     unknown-functions.h; sub_080409E8 is derived from this call site alone
 *     (five arguments, the `str r3,[sp]` being the fifth, and void).
 *   - gUnknown_03003100 is read BOTH ways in one function: `.pos` (u16, the
 *     `ldrh`s feeding address arithmetic and sub_080409E8) and `.spos` (s16,
 *     the `movs rI,#0; ldrsh` pair feeding sub_08024058). The union already
 *     models this; do not pick one view for the whole function.
 *   - `t` is a `u8` local, not an `int`: `t >> 5` is `lsrs`. That is the
 *     OPPOSITE of the neighbouring sub_08045BF0, whose `>> 6` is `asrs` and
 *     needs an `int`; check the shift before copying that note.
 *   - `t & 0x1f` must be written INLINE at all three comparison sites. Bound
 *     to a `terr` local it hoists above the `gPlaySt.unk09` test;
 *     inline, CSE keeps it in r3 exactly where the ROM has it.
