/* Reports the cell to sub_0803FF48 and then, for exactly two tile ids, rewrites
 * both map planes at that cell. The two `if`s are separate statements and not
 * an `else if` chain -- the ROM re-tests the snapshot after the first block
 * falls through rather than branching past it.
 *
 * The snapshot is taken BEFORE the sub_0803FF48 call and held in a
 * callee-saved register: gUnknown_08499590 is not const, so every store and
 * every call kills it, which is why the ROM reloads the base
 * (`ldr r1,[r6]`) for each of the four subsequent plane accesses while keeping
 * `y * 2`, 0x417A and 0xA22 live in r5, r8 and sb. That is the
 * `mov r7,sb; mov r6,r8` five-plus-live-values shape, not a loop.
 *
 * Plane addresses go through a struct laid over gUnknown_08499590 for the usual
 * reason: the ROM computes `(map + K) + idx`, which only a COMPONENT_REF
 * preserves. */
/* The sibling of DestroyPipeSeam next door: same snapshot-then-rewrite shape on
 * the two map planes, but keyed on tile 0x180 and driving the 0x0849FB8C
 * loader pair (sub_08040430 / sub_0804046C) instead of sub_0803FF48.
 *
 * 0x1CA is written twice and CSEd into r4 across both calls. The snapshot is
 * taken BEFORE them because gUnknown_08499590 is not const and every call kills
 * it -- which is also why the base is reloaded for each plane access afterwards
 * while `y * 2` and the plane constants stay live in sb/r8.
