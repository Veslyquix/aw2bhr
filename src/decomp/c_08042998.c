/*
 * sub_08042998 -- join the active unit with the unit on the target tile.
 *
 * The active unit is gUnknown_030040D8; the other unit is the one on the
 * tile at gUnknown_03003100.pos. The two are merged into the active unit:
 *   - HP: each unit's displayed HP (hp / 10, rounded up) is added. Anything
 *     above 10 is passed to sub_08025B58 for the current player, multiplied
 *     by sub_08042C9C's per-type value -- most likely the funds refund the
 *     game gives for excess HP. HP is then set to the total * 10.
 *   - unk05_3 is copied from the other unit; unk06_7 keeps the larger value.
 *   - Ammo and fuel are added and capped at the unit type's maximum.
 *   - With saving disabled and fog off, sub_08025B80 is called with
 *     gUnknown_03004074, which is then cleared.
 * Finally the other unit is removed (type = 0) and sub_080424E4 is called.
 *
 * Why the C looks odd:
 *   - The second HP term is a `?:` expression, and the ammo total is a u8
 *     `sum`. Both change which values the compiler reloads; the original
 *     reads maxAmmo again for the cap, which only this spelling reproduces.
 *   - Ammo goes through the local `q`, but fuel is written through
 *     gUnknown_030040D8 directly. Using `q` for both does not match.
