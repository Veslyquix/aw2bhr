/* Draws the handle's current frame. THREE parameters: r1 and r2 are copied out

 * own a2/a3 untouched, which is why the arity is invisible there -- the header
 * declaration was corrected this wave and c_0801C254.c re-verified.
 *
 * `flags` is initialised BEFORE the two null tests, which is where the ROM puts
 * `movs r2, #0` -- it is live across the merge at the PutSpriteExt call, so the
 * declaration-order statement is what places it. Nothing is returned: the exit
 * label is reached by three paths and none of them sets r0. */
