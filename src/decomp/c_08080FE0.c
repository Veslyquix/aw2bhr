/* sub_08080FE0 @ 0x08080FE0, 128 bytes, THUMB. Matched.
 *
 * Applies one 0x10-byte palette per unit slot 0..5 whose sub_08084858(i) is
 * truthy, then one more at the fixed slot 0x30A, then ticks the animation
 * counter at proc->unk64. The palette picked is always the same one --
 * `((s16)proc->unk64 >> 2) & 0xF` indexes gUnknown_0812598C -- so the loop
 * varies only in the destination.
 *
 * THE DESTINATION MUST BE WRITTEN WITH REAL SHIFTS, not a `(u16)` cast. The
 * ROM's accumulator holds the value PRE-SHIFTED by 16 (`ldr r6, =0x024A0000`,
 * `+= 0x80 << 0xe` per pass, `lsrs r1, r6, #0x10` at the use), which is
 * strength_reduce turning `(0x24a + i * 0x20) << 16` into a giv. `(u16)x`
 * expands to `x & 0xFFFF`, and an AND is not a giv operation, so the cast
 * spelling emits `lsl r1, r4, #0x15; ldr r2, =0x24a0000; add; lsr #0x10`
 * inside the loop instead. See docs/agbcc-codegen.md.
 *
 * `ldrh; lsls #0x10; asrs #0x12` is a u16 member with an explicit `(s16)`
 * cast then `>> 2` -- an s16 member would have folded to `ldrsh; asrs #2`.
 *
 * `proc + 0x64` is computed inside the loop and read after it; that live
 * range is real, and the tail's `ldrh [r5]` is the same object.
