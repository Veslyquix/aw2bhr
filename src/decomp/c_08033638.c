 * sub_080309AC's `s16` return with `lsls #0x10; asrs #0x10`, which is that
 * declared width and not a cast here.
 *
 * The halfword goes through an `int` TEMPORARY, and that is load-bearing:
 * written inline as `proc->unk2a = (b[1] << 8) | b[2]`, agbcc puts the shifted
 * value in r1 and the second byte in r0, where the ROM has them the other way
 * round. Naming the value gives the first operand the result register and
 * matches. The two spellings are otherwise identical, so this is register
 * allocation reacting to a declared local, not a difference in the expression. */
