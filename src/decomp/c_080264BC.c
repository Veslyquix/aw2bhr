/* Promoted from assembly; each function below is byte-for-byte
 * identical to the original. Order is address order and must
 * stay that way -- the linker places this file's .text as one
 * contiguous block at 0x080264BC.
 * GetTechScore @ 0x080264BC
 */

/* The same percentage ramp as GetSpeedScore, but over a unit's own current and
 * maximum values instead of a chapter threshold, and with a mode-dependent
 * baseline of 10 or 20.
 *
 * sub_08025CF0 / sub_08025D08 are taken with a bare `adds rN, r0, #0` and NO
 * re-narrowing, which is what re-typed both from `u8` to `int` this wave; see
 * the correction in include/unknown-functions.h.
 *
 * The `- 100` is a statement of its own. Folded into one expression agbcc
 * computes `(n + 100) - q` and spends an extra `adds` on the constant; the ROM
 * subtracts 100 from the quotient and only then negates against n.
 *
 * The result is assigned back into `x`, not to a fresh local. That is what puts
 * it in r4 -- x's own register, dead by then -- rather than r0.
 *
 * Named per Xenesis's AW2 Subroutine List: "Tech Scoring Subroutine". The
 * old GetTechScore symbol is kept as a linker alias below so every other
 * unit keeps resolving it unchanged. */
