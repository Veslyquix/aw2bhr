/* MATCHED wave 90 (W90-C). The 93.9% park was a +2/+2/-4 cancellation around
 * one fact: after `bl sub_0806377C` the ROM re-derives &gUnknown_08580934 from
 * its -fforce-addr word (`mov r1,r8; ldr r0,[r1]`), while a draft with the arm
 * written twice keeps the address in callee-saved r5. cse.c does not
 * invalidate an unchanging `.rodata` MEM at a call, so inside one extended
 * basic block the address from the dispatch test is reused after the call.
 * Written twice, the arm is fall-through code in that block. The ROM's arm
 * starts a new CSE block, so it follows a label with uses: it is written ONCE
 * and reached by two gotos.
 * The gotos are spelled out to keep the ROM's layout, `bne call; b arm;
 * <cnt = 0 break block>; call:`. jump1 folds `bne L1; b L2; L1:` into
 * `beq L2` when L1 directly follows the `b`. Here the loop's break block sits
 * between them in the source, as loop.c's exit-block move put it in the ROM.
 * `key = &keys[i]` in the second loop is still needed for the pointer giv.
 * Needs "rodata": ["0x0816E150"] (the force-addr word for gUnknown_08580934). */
