/* Promoted from assembly; each function below is byte-for-byte

/* MATCHED.
 *
 * The map planes go through `gMap` (include/map.h), the typed linker alias
 * for gUnknown_08499590. Plain `u8 *` arithmetic on it reassociates the
 * 0x1432 / 0x417A / 0x12 constants PAST the index -- the ROM adds the plane
 * constant to the base first, then the index -- and costs far more than the
 * tail below. `gMap` is named directly at every use rather than bound to a
 * local: the ROM keeps only its ADDRESS in sl and re-loads the pointer each
 * time. The two `sub_0801F92C`/`sub_080581A4` setup calls must also pass
 * `gMap->move` / `gMap->unk376A` (the plane's own array member, decays to
 * `u8 *`), not `gUnknown_08499590 + offset` or a cast -- agbcc's CSE only
 * reuses a pointer load across identical symbols, and mixing in the raw name
 * anywhere forces a second pool load (see sub_08057D90 for the fuller
 * writeup of this).
 *
 * gUnits is a REAL declared global, not a pool word, and so is
 * gUnknown_08499590 -- both trip the "named pointer whose target is also named"
 * false positive in the pool-word screen.
 *
 * THE LAST 8 BYTES, and the reason this is worth reading: hand-written C got to
 * 98.0% with the size exact, the relocations exact, the pool exact and all ten
 * words in order -- everything but four instructions:
 *
 *   original            plain `gUnits[c].unk00`
 *   ldr  r0, [pc,#208]  ldr  r0, [pc,#208]
 *   lsls r1, r4, #1     ldr  r1, [r0]
 *   adds r1, r1, r4     lsls r0, r4, #1
 *   lsls r1, r1, #2     adds r0, r0, r4
 *   ldr  r0, [r0]       lsls r0, r0, #2
 *   adds r0, r0, r1     adds r0, r0, r1
 *
 * The ROM computes `c * 12` BETWEEN the pool load of &gUnits and the
 * `ldr r0,[r0]` that dereferences it, hiding the load in the multiply, and gives
 * the multiply r1 rather than r0. No statement boundary reaches inside that
 * address expression, so no rewriting of the `&&` chain moves it.
 *
 * decomp-permuter closed it in 9,826 iterations, and the mutation it found is
 * the ASSIGNMENT-INSIDE-THE-EXPRESSION below: binding the element address to its
 * own local *within* the comparison creates that pseudo at a point ordinary
 * source cannot name, which is the same lever the comma-operator note in
 * docs/agbcc-codegen.md describes for pool ordering. This is the residual class
 * that doc's tail calls the permuter's own -- instruction ORDER, not stack slot
 * -- and it behaved exactly as advertised.
