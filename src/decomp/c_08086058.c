/* Family F062 (data/families.json): `push {r4,lr}; adds r4,r0,#0; bl A;

 * Both `adds` immediates are absent from `varies`, so only the two callees
 * differ.
 *
 * This is NOT the wave-14 F032 shape: there is no `lsls r0,#0x18; cmp r0,#0;
 * bne`, so the second call is unconditional and the first callee's result is
 * discarded. Whether the FIRST call receives the incoming r0 is decided
 * callee-side and the three members do not agree on it -- see each below.
 * `pop {r4}; pop {r0}` is still the void epilogue.

/* The OPPOSITE reading to sub_0801153C, in the same family, which is why every
 * member has to be checked rather than copied: sub_0808606C really does take
 * the proc -- it opens `adds r4,r0,#0` and dereferences +0x30, +0x4e and +0x5c
 * -- so both calls receive it. sub_0808603C next door drives the same object
 * through sub_0808606C, sub_080860DC and sub_08086688 in a row.
 *
 * Wave 44 (W44-C) retyped sub_0808606C's parameter to its own struct; ProcPtr
 * is `void *`, so the argument converts implicitly here and this stays
 * byte-for-byte identical. Re-verified with the new declaration in place.
