/* gUnknown_0816E10C is agbcc's own -fforce-addr word holding &gUnknown_08580934
 * (the ROM word at that address is 0x08580934), so naming the global honestly
 * gives the ROM's three-level `ldr rN,=<word>; ldr r5,[rN]; ldr r1,[r5]`.
 *
 * The +0x88 field is spelled `unk07 + (1 - unk15)`, and the parentheses are the
 * whole difference. Written `unk07 + 1 - unk15` fold associates it into
 * `unk07 - (unk15 - 1)` and emits `ldrb; subs #1; subs` -- same size, wrong
 * three instructions. `unk07 - unk15 + 1` gives `subs; adds`. Only the form
 * that keeps the constant on the LEFT operand's side survives fold as the
 * ROM's `adds #1; ldrb; subs`. */
