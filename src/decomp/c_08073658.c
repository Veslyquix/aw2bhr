 * rebuilds the word.
 *
 * Points the HBlank slot at gUnknown_0202F8DC, refills the BOTTOM 28 of its
 * 0xA0 scanline entries from the ROM table gUnknown_08614154, and arms DMA0 to
 * feed REG_BLDY one halfword per line. Every reach to gUnknown_0202FDE4 in this
 * function -- the store, the per-pass reload inside the loop and the
