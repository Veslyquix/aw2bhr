 * `cmp #1` is the re-narrowing agbcc applies to a narrow-returning callee, so
 * the handler returns a byte and the comparison is against 1 exactly.
 *
 * The advance and the `return TRUE` are the arm UNDER the `if` -- they sit
 * after the literal pool and the `beq` jumps to them -- so the guard is
 * written positively rather than as an early `return FALSE`. The handler is
 * bound to a local for the same ordering reason as sub_08015DC8. */
