/* MATCHED -- wave 80 (W80-B), byte-exact, relocs match. Same lever as
 * sub_08052718 / sub_08052BBC: a dead `k = b * 2;` after
 * `gUnknown_0300451C = b;` with the plain subscript kept everywhere. This is
 * what the wave-73 note's "comma at a different depth" was reaching for,
 * except it is not a comma at all: the reference is created by a statement
 * that generates the pseudo and nothing else, and cse connects it to the
 * store's index after the call, where get_inner_reference has put b * 2
 * first in the offset sum so the sum ties to it. The third parameter is
 * byte-neutral (wave 51) and kept for the sub_080536D8 table evidence. */
