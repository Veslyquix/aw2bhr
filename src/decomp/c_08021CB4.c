 * The bound is an `int` INDEX, not a pointer: the ROM's `cmp r3, r4; bgt` is a
 * SIGNED compare, and a pointer comparison is unsigned in agbcc (`bhi`).
 * strength_reduce rewrites `i > 0x5b` into the pointer form but keeps the
 * signedness of the original induction variable, which is what leaves `bgt`
 * behind.  The bound is also tested BEFORE the 0xFF terminator on every
 * iteration but not on entry, which is loop rotation of a `while (flags !=
 * 0xff)` whose body ends in the `if (i > 0x5b) break;`. */
