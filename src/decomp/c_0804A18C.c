 * with the arms swapped is the same predicate: the ROM branches `bne` to the

 * with no `lsrs`, as a truth test. Declared u8, agbcc re-narrows the result at
 * the call site (`lsls #24; lsrs #24`) BEFORE the store, which is two extra
 * instructions in the wrong place. The `(u8)` cast on the test is what
 * produces the ROM's lone `lsls`.
