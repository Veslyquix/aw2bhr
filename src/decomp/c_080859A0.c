/* A six-argument forwarder onto PutSprite. The last two arrive on the stack
 * (`ldr r1, [sp, #0x18]`, `ldr r7, [sp, #0x1c]`), and the SIXTH is the one that
 * becomes PutSprite's first argument -- so the two are not in a shared order
 * and the shape is not a pass-through.
 *
 * The first two parameters are `u16`: the `lsls #0x10; lsrs #0x10` pairs are
 * PROMOTE_MODE zero-extending declared-narrow parameters into their pseudos,
 * grouped with the other parameter copies at entry.
 *
 * `movs r1, #0x80; lsls r1, r1, #1` is just the constant 0x100 -- THUMB
 * immediates stop at 0xFF. The OAM word is `(c << 12) | (sub_080261A4(...) +
 * 0x100)`, with the shifted value as the OR's first operand (`orrs r4, r0`). */
