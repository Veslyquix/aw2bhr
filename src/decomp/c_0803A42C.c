/* Family F035 (data/families.json): `push {lr}; bl A; movs r0,#0; bl B; bl C;
 * pop {r0}; bx r0` -- 20 bytes, five members, and `varies` lists only the three
 * `bl` targets, so the `movs r0, #0` is byte-identical in every member.
 *
 * THREE STATEMENTS, not a nest. Sequential `bl`s carry no nesting signal at all
 * (docs/agbcc-codegen.md: r0 already holds the result, so the nest is the
 * spelling that needs no instruction), and the evidence is entirely callee-side:
 *   - callee A writes r0 before reading it, so it is nullary;
 *   - callee B does take an argument, but it is given an explicit `movs r0,#0`,
 *     which is what makes A's result dead;
 *   - callee C writes r0 before reading it, so a nest is not expressible.
 * `pop {r0}` is the void epilogue, so nothing is returned either.
