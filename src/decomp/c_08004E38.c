 * The `pop {r0}` fixes THIS function as void: it overwrites whatever
 * the callee returned, so nothing about the callee is visible from
 * here. Everything below was read off the callee's own body instead.
 *
 * Two parameters, passed straight through: the forwarder sets up no
 * argument register, and sub_0808B678 (src/decomp/c_0808B678.c) is a strcpy
 * taking `char *, const char *`. Its caller sub_08004E88 supplies both
 * (`ldr r0,[r4]; adds r0,#0x9c; adds r1, r5, #0`). The char * result is
 * dropped -- `pop {r0}`, not `pop {r1}`.
