/* `bl _call_via_r3` is an ordinary indirect THUMB call, not an interworking
 * veneer. The register index does NOT count arguments here: the pointer
 * arrives as parameter 2 in r1 and is moved to r3 because r0 carries the one
 * argument.
 *
 * TWO binding locals, each worth a couple of bytes and neither obvious:
 *
 * (1) `t` -- the shifted half of the packed word must be its own statement.
 *     Written `p->unk02 | p->unk03 << 16` the instructions are identical but
 *     the unk02 load is scheduled ahead of the unk03 load and shift; written
 *     the other way round (`p->unk03 << 16 | p->unk02`) the order is right but
 *     the OR's destination moves to the shift's register. Only splitting the
 *     shift out gives the ROM's `ldrb; lsls; ldrb; orrs r1, r0`.
 *
 * (2) `q` -- binding gUnknown_030033EC's ADDRESS before the indirect call is
 *     what makes it live ACROSS that call, so it takes a callee-saved register
 *     and its pool `ldr` is emitted at the top of the block, as in the ROM.
 *     Dereferenced in place the address is rematerialised into a scratch after
 *     the call instead. The load itself stays after the call either way.
 *
 * `ldrb r1, [r5]` on a u16 global is the u8 conversion of a halfword on a
 * little-endian target -- StartSupplyAnimation's unused second parameter is u8, and
 * this call site is the only thing in the tree that shows its width. */
/* WAVE 35: CANONICAL `struct Map`. Eight drafts across blocks 0x08029-0x0802B
 * each invented their own body for this tag, with 2 to 7 named fields. Every
 * one compiles and byte-matches ALONE, so trymatch cannot see the problem;
 * merged into a promoted unit it is a hard `redefinition of struct Map`.
 * All seven distinct bodies describe the SAME layout at different
 * resolutions -- the offsets reconcile exactly -- so this is their union, the
 * most refined reading of each region. Byte-neutral: only a field's START
 * OFFSET enters the address arithmetic, never its declared length, and no
 * draft referenced any filler. Keep the drafts in sync; sync_work.py
 * reintroduces whatever the drafts say. */
