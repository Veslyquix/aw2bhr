/* MATCHED in wave 79 (W79-A). PROMOTION MUST CARRY "rodata": ["0x08090B58"]
 * -- the pool word holds 0x020237B0 and trymatch reports it as "different
 * symbols that resolve to the same address", which is the wave-18 pool
 * placement working as designed, not a difference.
 *
 * Parked across waves 38/42/52/58 at 92.6% (the 96.6% in those entries was
 * best.c's score, not the draft's). The recorded residual was exact: the ROM's
 * second ABS block compares and negates the ORIGINAL (`adds r2,r0,#0;
 * cmp r0,#0; bge; rsbs r2,r0,#0`) where the candidate compared and negated the
 * COPY, giving abs_b five references against the ROM's three, so global_alloc
 * ranked abs_b above `a` and the two swapped hard registers. ~40,000 permuter
 * iterations from two different starting points and six spellings of ABS could
 * not reach it, because the permuter is a register-level tool and the cause is
 * upstream of allocation.
 *
 * The whole fix is `register int t asm("r0");` on the ternary result. Pinning
 * the result forces the ternary's target into the ROM's register, and the ABS
 * expansions fall out in the ROM's form -- original-compared second block
 * included. (Pinning the two ABS results to r4/r2 instead is a second match of
 * the same shape; this one-line form is the one kept.)
 *
 * STILL VALID from the parked evidence:
 *   - +0x26 and +0x28 are s16 (the `movs rI,#0x26; ldrsh` object tell); the
 *     rest of the struct is u16.
 *   - The loop condition is a SIGNED int compare of the u16 difference.
 *
 * WHAT THE FUNCTION IS: snapshots the map scroll origin into +0x1e/+0x20,
 * stores the two axis deltas from the target at +0x22/+0x24 into +0x26/+0x28,
 * then writes a 1,2,3,...,8,8,8 acceleration ramp into gUnknown_020237B0 whose
 * terms sum to the larger delta, with the remainder as a final short step.
 * p->unk2a ends holding the number of steps written. */
