 *
 * The three read-modify-write groups are struct Unk02028360's bitfields and
 * each one's ACCESS WIDTH is what names it: `ldrb`/`strb` at +2 with ~0x38
 * then ~0x07 for unk02_3 and unk02_0 (two separate 3-bit inserts, not one
 * 6-bit field -- a single field would clear with ~0x3f once), `ldrh`/`strh`
 * at +2 with 0xFFFFFC3F for unk02_6 because bits 6..9 straddle the byte
 * boundary, and `ldrb`/`strb` at +3 with ~0x3c for unk02_a. Exactly the
 * boundaries the type's own comment already records from sub_0803E01C and
 * sub_0803EB40, reached here from the clearing side.
 *
 * Only ONE `strb` comes out of the first pair: agbcc CSEs the +2 byte across
 * the two inserts and then drops the first store as dead. */
