/* PARKED, wave 31 (W31-C). m4aSongNumStart.
 *
 * Compiles to the right 44 bytes with the right instruction stream and the
 * right literal pool order; the ONLY difference is register allocation.
 * The ROM puts the mplay-table address in r2 and `song->ms` in r3:
 *
 *     ldr r2, =gUnknown_08242308      <- candidate uses r3
 *     ldr r1, =gUnknown_0824238C
 *     lsrs r0, r0, #0xd
 *     adds r0, r0, r1
 *     ldrh r3, [r0, #4]               <- candidate uses r2
 *
 * The candidate produces the same two quantities with r2 and r3 exchanged --
 * every instruction, the pool, and the size are otherwise identical.
 *
 * RULED OUT, twelve source spellings, all producing the identical allocation:
 * with and without a `songTable` local; with and without a `mplay` local; with
 * and without a `u16` / `u32` / `int` local for `ms`; `&t[n]` vs `t + n`;
 * `(p + i)->info` vs `p[i].info`; binding `info` and `header` to locals first;
 * fully inlining both tables into the call; declaring the two tables `const`
 * and non-`const`. Declaration ORDER is not free either -- swapping the two
 * table locals swaps the literal pool words, which the ROM fixes.
 *
 * The two competing quantities are the mplay-table address (2 refs, live
 * across ~8 insns) and `ms` (3 refs, live across 2), and GCC 2.9's local-alloc
 * priority is monotone in refs / live-length, so `ms` is allocated first under
 * every spelling. Whatever makes the ROM allocate the table first is not
 * reachable from the statement shape of this function -- suspect the TYPE model
 * of one of the two tables instead.
 *
 * sub_08070544 and sub_08070578 are the same function with a guard added, and
 * park on exactly the same difference.
 *
 * WAVE 32 (W32-B) applied the wave-31 allocation rule to this function -- the
 * rule this same agent measured -- and the rule PREDICTS THE CANDIDATE, NOT THE
 * ROM. That is the finding; it is a limit on the rule, not a lever.
 *
 * The two competing quantities and their gcc-2.9 local-alloc priorities
 * (floor_log2(n_refs) * n_refs * size / (death - birth), sorted DESCENDING):
 *
 *   &gUnknown_08242308   n_refs 2, born at the pool `ldr`, dies at
 *                        `adds r1,r1,r2` -- live 8 insns
 *                        priority = 1 * 2 * 1 / 8 = 0.25
 *   song->ms             n_refs 3, born at the `ldrh`, dies two insns later at
 *                        `adds r1,r1,r3` -- live 2 insns
 *                        priority = 1 * 3 * 1 / 2 = 1.50
 *
 * `ms` is allocated first and takes the lowest free hard register, r2. That is
 * exactly what the candidate does. The ROM has it the other way, so the ROM's
 * source cannot be a cosmetic variant of this one.
 *
 * The three questions, answered:
 *   1. Ref-count power-of-two crossing? NOT REACHABLE. To overtake `ms` the
 *      table address needs floor_log2(n)*n > 12, i.e. n_refs 8; it has 2, and
 *      no spelling creates more without adding instructions. Crossing 3->4
 *      only lifts it to 1.00, still under 1.50.
 *   2. Tied, so the declared-local tiebreak applies? NO -- 0.25 against 1.50 is
 *      not a tie. Measured directly: declaration order moves the LITERAL POOL
 *      WORDS and never these two registers (three more spellings this wave --
 *      fully inlined, mplay-element bound, index bound to a local declared
 *      first -- on top of W31-C's twelve).
 *   3. An index add whose operand order would have to change? NO. Both adds
 *      already have the symbolic base as operand 2, in the ROM and in every
 *      candidate.
 *
 * So all three levers are absent, which means the difference is upstream of
 * statement shape. Recorded as a TYPE-MODEL question, per the rule's own
 * instruction to stop there: something about `struct MusicPlayer`,
 * `struct Song` or the two tables' declared types must give the table address
 * either more references or a shorter live range than this model does.
 *
 * NEW this wave and worth keeping: writing the song lookup INLINE rather than
 * through a `song` local fixes the LITERAL POOL ORDER on the two conditional
 * members (sub_080704A4, sub_080704F0), taking them from a reversed pool to
 * 93.4% / 94.0% with five bytes differing. All five members of this family now
 * park on the identical single residual.
