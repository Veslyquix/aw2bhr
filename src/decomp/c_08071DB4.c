#include "hardware.h"
/* Opens blending inside both windows and inside neither, sets the blend
 * effect to 3 (darken), then commits a full target1/target2 layer mask and
 * seeds the proc's fade accumulator.
 *
 * The two masked inserts are raw halfword writes, not bitfield stores:
 * `ldrh` with a POOL mask is the raw tell, and 0x1F / 0x1F00 set five layer
 * bits at a time, which no single `.bits` assignment can produce. The
 * `orr #0x20` one line later is the same object through `.bits` -- `ldrb`
 * with a `movs` mask -- and the two spellings sitting a line apart is
 * exactly the case the hardware.h note describes.
 *
 * THE CAST IS LOAD-BEARING; `gUnknown_030030E0.raw` does NOT substitute for
 * it here. An isolated probe of the two spellings side by side emits
 * identical code, but in this function `.raw` costs +4 bytes: it materialises
 * the 0 written to gUnknown_03002020 into its own pseudo that stays live
 * across the insert (it comes back as a dead `orrs r1, r3`), which shuffles
 * the whole allocation and pushes an extra literal into the pool. Same
 * family as the wave-15 rule -- a probe agreeing about two spellings is
 * evidence about the PROBE's context, not a general fact. sub_0807F2FC, two
 * functions along, matches with either spelling, so this is not a property
 * of the symbol.
 *
 * agbcc emits ONE ldrh/strh pair for both inserts: the second statement's
 * load is forwarded from the first's store because the object is not
 * volatile. The 0x1F00 arrives as `movs #0xf8; lsls #5` and the 0x100 at the
 * end as `adds r1, #0xf0` off the 0x10 still live in r1 from unk64. */
