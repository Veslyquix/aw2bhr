/* The blend-shadow family described on gUnknown_030030E0 in hardware.h. The
 * two 5-bit target groups go through the SCALAR `u16 *` cast, not through
 * `.raw`: the union spelling drags the live zero from `gUnknown_03002B28 = 0`
 * into a spurious `orr` and costs a register -- the same failure c_08085F40.c
 * records. The single backdrop bits either side of them are genuine QImode
 * bitfields (`ldrb`, `movs #0x21; neg` mask).
 *
 * `gUnknown_03001FFC = gUnknown_03001FFC;` is a real self-store and is only
 * spellable because that global is volatile; without the qualifier the whole
 * statement is deleted and the `ldrh`/`strh` pair disappears. */
