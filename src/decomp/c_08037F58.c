/* Family F011: `push {lr}; bl f; ldr r0,=g; movs r1,#N; bl h; pop {r0}; bx r0`.
 * Two statements and NOT a nest -- r0 is overwritten by the pool `ldr` between
 * the two calls, so nothing can survive from the first one. `pop {r0}` is the
 * void epilogue.
 *
 * sub_08037F18 is a bare `bx lr` -- an empty function, not a missing one.
 *
 * The `(s32)` cast is forced by sub_080152C0's declaration, which
 * unknown-functions.h flags as SUSPECT (the parameter is almost certainly
 * `const void *`). It is byte-neutral -- `ldr r0,=gSym` either way -- so this
 * is one more call site paying the cast, and it comes out free. */
