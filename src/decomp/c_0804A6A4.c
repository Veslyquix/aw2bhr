 * same struct sub_0804A6A4 next door reaches with a plain pool word. Reading it
 * as a real global costs one indirection too many -- the trap the
 * gUnknown_0812A2A8 note records.
 *
 * The loop compare is UNSIGNED (`bhs`/`blo`) because both sides are u8 and
 * shorten_compare narrows the comparison back into the shorter unsigned type;
 * sub_0804A6A4's bound is `unk5f + 1`, an int, and comes out signed.
 *
 * The RETURN TYPE IS NOT void, and the epilogue is the only thing that says so:
 * the ROM pops the return address into r1 (`pop {r1}; bx r1`) where every void
 * neighbour in this block -- sub_0804AE78, sub_0804B850, sub_0804BAC4,
 * sub_0804A1E4 -- pops it into r0. agbcc keeps r0 clear at the epilogue when it
 * holds a return value. Both arms end in a void call, so nothing supplies one
 * and the value is whatever sub_0803B4DC left; that is what the original did. */
