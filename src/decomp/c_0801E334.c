 * way and this function's own bytes cannot settle the return type. Its caller
 * sub_0801E950 can and does: it forwards the result into sub_0801E0C8's `int`
 * parameter with no re-narrowing, and agbcc re-narrows a narrow-returning
 * callee at every call site. Re-verified with trymatch after the change. */
