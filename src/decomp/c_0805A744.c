/* Consumes the cell list sub_0805A514 (src/decomp/c_0805A514.c) produces:
 * seeds the map's 0x3C72 plane to 0x7F, redraws the 0x2852 plane, then for each
 * listed cell drives the gUnknown_030013EC hook and floods the 0x3C72 plane
 * with that cell's threat value wherever the terrain code is 0xd or 0xb and the
 * value beats what is already there.
 *
 * THE RECORD TYPE IS SETTLED BY A PRODUCER/CONSUMER PAIR, not by guesswork --
 * the wave brief's one real oracle for a byte-neutral type. sub_0805A514 writes
 * {u8 x; u8 y; s16 v;} records and terminates the array with `out->v = 0xFFFF`;
 * this function walks the same 4-byte stride and stops on `v == -1`. Same
 * struct, declared here rather than shared because it describes only a pointer
 * parameter.
 * TWO THINGS IN THE INNER BODY WERE MEASURED, NOT GUESSED:
 *  - `cell` is bound as a pointer, and that is what makes the two sign-extended
 *    reads `ldrsb rN,[cell,rZERO]` instead of sub_0805AD90's `ldrb; lsl; asr`.
 *    THUMB ldrsb has only a register-offset form, so agbcc will materialise a
 *    zero register for it when the address is a live pointer local and will not
 *    when the address dies at the load. Reading it as evidence that the array
 *    is signed would be wrong: it is the SAME gUnknown_03003340, and the u8
 *    read that supplies the stored value sits right beside it.
 *  - `w` is REUSED for the terrain mask and then for the s8 compare. A fresh
 *    local there is size-exact with r0/r1 swapped through the final block.
 *
 * MATCHED, 1 attempt after 2 probes. */
