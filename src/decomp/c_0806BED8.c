/* The string loader for the sub_0806BE7C proc (src/decomp/c_0806BD84.c): starts
 * it, seeds the row it will spin in at +0x58, and converts a NUL-terminated
 * byte string into the +0x2a halfword table of sprite tiles, leaving the length
 * in +0x54 -- which is exactly the bound sub_0806BE7C counts +0x5c up to. The
 * two functions agree on struct Unk6BE7CParent independently, so the layout is
 * a producer/consumer pair rather than one function's guess.
 *
 * `lsls #0x11; lsrs #0x10` is a net LEFT shift of one under a u16 truncation,
 * i.e. `(u16)((c - 0x41) * 2)` -- two tiles per letter. Per the wave-16 rule it
 * has to reach the compiler as a MULTIPLY, not `<< 1`: shorten_binary_op folds a
 * MULT into the narrow mode where a shift needs a third instruction. Assigning
 * to the `u16` local supplies the truncation, so no explicit cast is needed. */

/* Draws one screen's worth of rows from the gUnknown_0858265C entry the proc's
 * +0x38 selects: six 8-byte records, each a tag plus a string. Tag 1 renders
 * the string, tags 3/4/5 blit one of three fixed blobs. If nothing at all was
 * drawn the proc jumps to label 1; otherwise the cursor is armed and +0x30 is
 * cleared.
 *
 * Four independent `if`s, NOT a switch and not an else-chain: the ROM re-loads
 * the tag before each test and every arm falls through into the next.
 *
 * THE ONE LEVER, and it is worth 8 bytes plus the whole register assignment:
 * the row cursor must be written `gUnknown_08499578 + (i * 0x60 + 0x29)`, with
 * the integer arithmetic PARENTHESISED, not `gUnknown_08499578 + i * 0x60 +
 * 0x29`. The latter parses as `((p + i * 0x60) + 0x29)`, which gives
 * strength_reduce a giv of `i * 0xc0` and leaves an `adds r0, #0x52` at each of
 * the two use sites; grouping the index folds the constant INTO the giv's init,
 * so the ROM's two separate cursors start at 0x52 and 0x92 and are each bumped
 * by 0xc0 at the loop bottom. That extra register pressure is also what spills
 * the proc to the stack -- with one giv it stays in sl and there is no
 * `sub sp, #4`, so the frame and the address arithmetic are ONE fact here, not
 * two. Same family as the documented `p[X + C]` vs `*(p + X + C)` rule. */
