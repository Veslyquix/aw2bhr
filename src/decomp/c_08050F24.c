/* The one lever was the evaluation ORDER inside the gUnknown_08553640
 * subscript: the ROM reads gUnknown_03004580[a ^ 1][2] first, parks it, and
 * only then loads the gUnknown_085D6A48 pool word and walks the row, which
 * fixes the pool order 08553640, 03004580, 085D6A48.
 *
 * Wave 34 recorded that the c_08050B70.c comma trick "does NOT work for the
 * other operand, because operand complexity is decided before the side effect
 * is considered". That is REFUTED. agbcc does expand the more complex operand
 * of the multiply first -- so the fix is not to move the simple operand, it is
 * to put the ASSIGNMENT of the simple operand inside the complex one, ahead of
 * everything else in it, and leave the bare variable as the second operand.
 * The complexity ranking is then untouched and the side effect rides along in
 * the operand that is already going first. */
