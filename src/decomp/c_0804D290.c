/* MATCHED -- byte-for-byte identical to the original.
 *
 * Rebuilds the OBJ attributes of the current gUnknown_03001470 slot, reseeds
 * the gUnknown_02029A10 entry's position from the ROM table sub_08057D44 hands
 * back, then arms a continuation out of gUnknown_08552FB8. Same family as
 * sub_0804D928 / sub_0804E3B4 / sub_0804EEFC -- see those for the `* 0x100`,
 * the `pal`/`prio` temporaries and the `(e1 = &pos[...])` binding.
 *
 * TWO of the three constructs below are levers, not natural source, and both
 * are load-bearing. Removing either costs 12 bytes and takes the function from
 * exact to 588 bytes -- SMALLER than the ROM, which is the tell.
 *
 * 1. `ox` / `oy`. The ROM materialises BOTH camera-origin pointers, one of them
 *    into `ip`, before it computes even the first argument of sub_080155C0.
 *    Only a pair of locals forces that order.
 *
 * 2. `do { } while (0)`. The wave-16 allocation lever: allocno_compare weights
 *    every reference by loop_depth, so a zero-trip loop promotes the pseudos
 *    inside it. Without it the 0xb4 gUnknown_02029A10 group stride (six
 *    references) takes r6 and &gUnknown_03004580 (two) is pushed to sl, which
 *    saves a `mov` at each of five `muls` -- in the ROM's favour.
 *
 * 3. `(meta = gUnknown_03004580, ...)`. This one is the whole last 22 bytes and
 *    it is a POSITION, not a value: `meta` is never read. Of two address
 *    constants each used twice in the same two statements, agbcc gives the
 *    callee-saved register to whichever pseudo is created FIRST, and emits that
 *    one's `ldr` at the head of the statement while the loser is rematerialised
 *    at each use. The ROM's pool order is 085D6A48, 03004580, 03004582, so
 *    &gUnknown_03004580's pseudo must exist AFTER gUnknown_085D6A48's outer base
 *    and BEFORE gUnknown_03004582's inner one -- a point inside argument 1 that
 *    no statement boundary can reach. The two neighbouring spellings each miss
 *    by exactly one slot: with no anchor the `ldr` lands twelve instructions
 *    late (96.3%), and with `meta = gUnknown_03004580;` as its own statement
 *    ahead of the call it lands one instruction early and swaps the same two
 *    pool words the other way (99.7%, two bytes).
 *
 * Ruled out by measurement: old_agbcc (624 B), -fno-force-addr (bit-identical
 * output, so these `ldr`s are not a -fforce-addr artefact), a `u16 (*)[8]`
 * local for the reads, `*(g[i] + 3)`, `(&g[0][3])[i * 8]`, a struct row for
 * 085D6A48 column 0, and 300 s of decomp-permuter.
