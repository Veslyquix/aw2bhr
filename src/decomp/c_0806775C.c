 * `lsls #2` index might suggest.

 * +0x30 is read back through the register the table element is still sitting
 * in (`movs r1, #0; ldrsb r1, [r2, r1]`), not through a reload of +0x2c: the
 * intervening `str` to +0x38 is SImode and a word store does not invalidate a
 * cached load, so `proc->unk2c[0]` costs no second `ldr`.
