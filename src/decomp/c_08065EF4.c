 * address the ROM keeps in r4.
 *
 * gUnknown_0816E120 is copied WHOLE (a struct assignment, three ldm/stm pairs).
 * See its note in unknown-globals.h for why it is named as a global rather than
 * written as an auto aggregate's initialiser -- both give these exact 116
 * bytes, only this one relocates against the address the ROM does. */
