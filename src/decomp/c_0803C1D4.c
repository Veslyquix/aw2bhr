/* The four-array copy in the middle is what settles gPlaySt's 0x33 /
 * 0x38 / 0x3d / 0x42 as four parallel 5-byte per-slot arrays indexed 1..4: the
 * loop increment `adds r2, r6, #1` is computed once and used as the index
 * against all four bases, which no 0x34/0x39/0x3e/0x43-based spelling can
 * produce (those would index with r6 and fold the +1 into the constant).
 *
 * gUnknown_08580934's +0x20 table is the fourth sibling of +0x09/+0x0d/+0x11,
 * carved out of what wave 36 had guessed as unk1c[8].
 *
 * `case 1:` is a real case and not the default: gcc's balanced dispatch for
 * {0,1,2,3} opens with `cmp #1; beq` / `cmp #1; bgt`, and for {0,2,3} it would
 * pivot on 2 instead. Its arm is identical to the default's, so the two share
 * one block.
 *
 * The `strb r3` stores of 0 and 2 in the case-0 and case-2 arms are cse2
 * reusing the switch value, which it knows equals the case constant inside the
 * arm -- the source writes plain literals. */
