/* gUnknown_08090A74 and gUnknown_08090A78 are NOT globals: they are
 * `-fforce-addr` .rodata address-constant words holding &gUnknown_030033EC and
 * &gUnknown_08499598 (dumped from baserom.gba), so both globals are named
 * directly here and agbcc rebuilds the pool. Each is read on both sides of the
 * gUnknown_03004080 test, which is the control-flow merge that forces the
 * words in the first place.
 *
 * The embedded `(n = ...)` is load-bearing on BOTH counts and neither is
 * cosmetic. The ROM holds one loaded halfword in r2 across the first and THIRD
 * store and re-`ldrh`s only for the middle one, so all three spelled as the
 * global is +4 bytes (three loads) and all three spelled as `n` is -2
 * (`subs r0,r2,#1`). And the assignment has to happen INSIDE the first
 * statement rather than in one of its own: a leading `n = gUnknown_030033EC;`
 * creates the force-addr pseudo before gUnknown_03004084's, which swaps the
 * first two pool words. */
