/* Third member of the sub_0804D290 / sub_0804DCA8 family (both matched, both
 * 600 B) -- same subsystem, same `pos` reseed out of sub_08057D44, same
 * `entry->x - *ox` tail. The two levers that closed those two do NOT transfer,
 * and that was measured rather than assumed (see docs/agbcc-codegen.md):
 * the wave-17 `(meta = gUnknown_03004580, ...)` comma anchor is BYTE-NEUTRAL
 * here, and the zero-trip `do { } while (0)` around the sub_08057D44 call is a
 * REGRESSION. What does transfer is the `(e1 = &pos[..][..])->x` binding pair,
 * which is worth 3 instructions and takes the draft from 124 differing
 * instruction lines to 21.
 *
 * `int x0` is the last lever and it is the interesting one. The ROM
 * sign-extends `v` (`lsls #16; asrs #16`) before adding it to unk04, even
 * though the sum is immediately stored with `strh` and the extension is
 * therefore dead. Every cast spelling on the OPERAND -- `(s16)v` with `v`
 * declared `s16`, `u16` or `int` -- is byte-identical and folds, because
 * combine's force_to_mode sees the 16-bit store and drops the extension. What
 * stops it is binding the SUM to an `int`: the addition then has a 32-bit
 * consumer, the extension is no longer redundant, and it survives. `x0` is
 * never read. Found by decomp-permuter at iteration 5018 after four hand
 * rounds had failed on it, and it is the same "bind at the right depth" family
 * as the two levers above -- here the depth is the result, not an operand.
 *
 * `pos` rows are 40 bytes because sub_08057D44 hands back a 2-D view:
 * `pos[gUnknown_03004580[i][5]][i * 5 + j]` of 4-byte (x, y) pairs, the shape
 * data/parked.json records for sub_0804FA2C. The gUnknown_03004504 guard is
 * wave 19's nested-bitfield rule -- two separate mask tests, not an `&&`.
 * Promotion must carry rodata: ["0x08136080", "0x08136084", "0x08136088",
 * "0x0813608C"], the -fforce-addr copies of &gUnknown_03001FBC,
 * &gUnknown_0300453C, &gUnknown_0300451C and &gUnknown_03004580. */
