/* An install-then-disable pair: start the gUnknown_0849A990 script (the literal
 * 0 second argument every other sub_080152EC wrapper passes) and clear BG0 in
 * the DISPCNT shadow.
 *
 * Byte 1 bit 0 of gDispIo is DISPCNT bit 8, i.e. disp_ct.bg0_enable. The mask
 * arrives as `movs r0,#2; rsbs r0,r0,#0` -- the SImode -2 -- and not as a
 * `movs r0,#0xfe`, because the bitfield container is u16 and the complement is
 * formed before the byte-wide read-modify-write is narrowed. sub_0802C390 in
 * this same block is the setting half of the pair and emits the expected
 * `movs r1,#1; orrs`, which is what makes bit 0 of byte 1 the discriminating
 * use rather than a byte-neutral guess.
 *
 * sub_080152EC's returned slot is discarded (`pop {r0}; bx r0`), so this is
 * void and the call is a bare statement.
