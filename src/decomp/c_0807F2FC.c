/* Brighten setup with no proc: effect = 2, the two BLDALPHA coefficients

 * EXCLUDES the backdrop.
 *
 * `gUnknown_03002020 = gUnknown_03002020;` is real source, not a typo. Both
 * coefficients are volatile, and a self-assignment on a volatile lvalue is
 * the only thing that emits `ldrh r0,[r1]; strh r0,[r1]` -- agbcc deletes
 * `g = g` outright on a plain object. It is the same tell recorded for
 * gUnknown_03002F18 in unknown-globals.h, here on two symbols at once, and
 * it is independent confirmation that the volatile qualifier on this pair is
 * right.
 *
 * The `movs #0x21; rsbs` clearing target1_enable_bd is the byte-mask
 * bitfield idiom from c_080688E4.c, sitting between two `.raw` inserts on
 * the same object -- `ldrh` with a pool mask either side of an `ldrb` with a
 * `movs`/`neg` mask, which is the hardware.h rule in one statement run. */
