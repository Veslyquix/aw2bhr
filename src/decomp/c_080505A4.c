/* The two levers, both measured:
 *   - The gUnknown_085D6A48 ROW must be a STRUCT. `gUnknown_085D6A48[j][10]` on
 *     the declared `u16 [][12]` emits `adds rB,#0x14; ldrh [rB]` where the ROM
 *     keeps the offset in the load displacement.
 *   - The COMMA ANCHOR fixes the pool order. The ROM loads gUnknown_085D6A48's
 *     address BEFORE gUnknown_03004580's; the flat subscript loads them the
 *     other way round because the subscript is evaluated first. Assigning the
 *     table base inside the condition, ahead of the subscript, reverses it
 *     without moving anything else -- see docs/agbcc-codegen.md.
 *   - `t` is a u16 local computed before the first `if` (hence the u16
 *     truncation the ROM has there); the second `* 7 + 5` is an `int` local
 *     declared inside the second `if`, which is what puts it ahead of the two
 *     pool loads and gives it no truncation of its own. */
