/* Promoted from assembly; each function below is byte-for-byte

 * sub_08050424 @ 0x08050424

/* The whole function is three statements plus the call. Two shift pairs are net
 * LEFT shifts with a u16 truncation and must be written as MULTIPLIES:
 * `a3 * 0x200` from `lsls #0x19; lsrs #0x10` and `* 0x20` from `lsls #0x15;
 * lsrs #0x10`. The third parameter is `int`, not u16 -- src/decomp/c_0805040C.c
 * forwards a u16 `c` and its own third lsls/lsrs pair belongs to that wrapper.
 *
 * The one lever is the COMMA ANCHOR. The ROM materialises gUnknown_085D6A48's
 * address BETWEEN `a1 * 0x100` and the scaled row index, which no plain address
 * expression reaches: fold canonicalises PLUS(ADDR_EXPR, MULT_EXPR) so the
 * index becomes operand 0 and the pool ldr lands after it. Binding the base to
 * a local in its own statement puts the ldr at the TOP of the function instead
 * (measured: registers then match the ROM exactly, only the ldr is five
 * instructions early). The comma inside operand 1 of the sum creates the
 * reference at a point no statement boundary can reach, and that is exact.
 *
 * The struct is what keeps the column offset in the load displacement --
 * `gUnknown_085D6A48[j][9]` on the declared `u16 [][12]` emits
 * `adds rB,#0x12; ldrh [rB]` where the ROM has `ldrh [rB, #0x12]`. */
