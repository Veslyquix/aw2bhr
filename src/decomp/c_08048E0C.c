/* Same family as sub_080039E4/sub_08003A80 but with the two library calls
 * split around the window setup: sub_0801237C first, the gDispIo/030030A4/
 * 030030DC block, then sub_08012358 and only afterwards the blend groups.
 *
 * No raw-halfword write and no zero anywhere in the function -- every constant
 * that appears twice (2, 4, 8, 0x10, 0x20) is materialised once and held, and
 * `gUnknown_03002B40 = 2;` is what creates the `2` the blend group later
 * reuses, which is why that store cannot move. */
