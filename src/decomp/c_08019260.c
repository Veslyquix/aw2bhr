/* `bool8` and not the `int` this was promoted with. Every one of the twenty

 * them (`lsls #0x18; lsrs r4,#0x18` and `lsrs r1,#0x18`) KEEP the value rather
 * than truth-testing it, which the bare-`lsls` truth test would not have done.
 * A `bool8` local at one call site is byte-identical to a `bool8` callee, so
 * one site proves nothing -- twenty do. The body is unaffected: it returns the
 * literals 0 and 1, so nonzero_bits is already <= 1 and gcc drops the return
 * narrowing. Re-verified byte-exact with trymatch after the change. */
