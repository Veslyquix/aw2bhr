/* The army loop clears gUnknown_0849B018->unk0a[i] only for armies
 * sub_0802F460 reports as gone, but clears gUnknown_0300449C[i] for all four.
 * Both stores carry the dead-`ldrb`-before-`strb` volatile tell.
 *
 * Wave 51, W51-B -- CORRECTION. This comment used to read the ABSENCE of that
 * tell on the gUnknown_03003F1C store two lines above as fixing that global as
 * NOT volatile. It does not: the dead load appears only where the assignment's
 * VALUE is consumed (a chained assignment), and this store is in statement
 * position. gUnknown_03003F1C IS volatile, decided by its only reader,
 * sub_080319AC, where the qualifier is worth 3 bytes. This function is
 * unchanged by it and still matches.
 *
 * The `strb r2` reusing sub_0802F460's returned zero rather than a fresh
 * `movs` is cse propagating the known value inside the `== 0` arm; the
 * gUnknown_0300449C store sits at the merge, where it is not known, and
 * materialises its own 0. Both are plain `= 0` in the source. */
