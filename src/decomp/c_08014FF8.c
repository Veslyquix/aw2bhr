/* Aligned allocate from the gUnknown_03000050 heap, the sibling of HeapAlloc
 * (sub_08014DCC). Alignments of 16 or less defer to sub_08014E44. Otherwise
 * it best-fits the smallest free block that can hold `size` (rounded up to 16)
 * at an `align`-aligned address past its header. The gap in front of the
 * aligned address goes back to the heap, as a free block when it is large
 * enough and otherwise to the previous block. The tail is split off as a new
 * free block when at least 32 bytes remain.
 *
 * Two quirks are in the ROM, not in this transcription. The small-gap arm
 * points the previous block 64 bytes before the new header
 * (`(struct MemBlock *)data - 4`), and the no-split arm stores the distance to
 * the next block in words, not bytes.
 *
 * Measured spelling notes:
 * - `next = cur; best = next;` in the taken branch clobbers the register CSE
 *   would reuse for `cur->next`, which forces the ROM's reload of it.
 * - One cursor `p` walks the list for the previous block, writes the gap's
 *   header and finally holds the split-off tail, read back through
 *   `hdr->next` as in HeapAlloc. The best == head test compares against a
 *   fresh load of gUnknown_03000050 rather than `p`. If `p` is the value
 *   compared, cse knows p == best in that arm and deletes the ROM's
 *   `mov r2, r8` (-4 bytes with padding).
 * - The gap arms reach the block through `p = best` and the tail through
 *   `best`. The different pseudos keep GCSE from sharing `data - best`
 *   between them.
 * - The large-gap arm's size and the `<= 32` test use `* 4`, which is signed
 *   int (`bgt`) and CSEs with the gap already computed in bytes. With
 *   `* sizeof(u32)` it is unsigned, and the test changes and the arms
 *   cross-jump one instruction earlier.
