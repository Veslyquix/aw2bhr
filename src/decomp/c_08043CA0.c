 * Filters the 19-entry CO display order at gUnknown_084A077C down to the
 * unlocked ones (sub_0803CAB8), packs them into gUnknown_020288A0, writes the
 * 0xff terminator and returns the count.
 *
 * Both globals are reached through the file's `-fforce-addr` .rodata block at
 * 0x08091350-0x0809138C, i.e. `ldr rN,[pool] (= 0x08091378); ldr rM,[rN]`.
 * That is one plain subscript in the source, not two dereferences -- the
 * honest spelling emits the .rodata word itself and trymatch reports
 * `name different symbols that resolve to the same address`, which is a MATCH.
 * The words were identified by dereferencing 0x08091378/0x0809137C in
 * baserom.gba (-> 0x084A077C and 0x020288A0).
 *
 * `u8 n` and `u8 i` are both hard: every increment is `adds #1; lsls #0x18;
 * lsrs #0x18`, and the loop bound reads `cmp r5,#0x12; bls` (unsigned <= 18).

 * Takes sub_08043CA0's unlocked-CO list and DOUBLES it in place until it is

 *
 * `(u8)(n - 1) <= 5` is gcc's range test for `n != 0 && n <= 6` on an
 * unsigned char: the ROM computes `(n << 24) - 0x01000000` and reuses the
 * `n << 24` it already had for the narrowing, then `lsrs #0x18; cmp #5; bhi`.
 *
 * `n += k` and not `n *= 2`: the ROM adds the inner loop's counter register
 * (`adds r0, r3, r2`), which is only equal to n because the guard keeps n
 * non-zero.  A doubling would have been `lsls r0, r3, #1`.
