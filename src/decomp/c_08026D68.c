/* The per-army terrain census. Clears each army's tallies, then walks every
 * cell of the gUnknown_08499590 map: the top three bits of the +0x1432 terrain
 * byte select the owning army and the low five are the terrain id, so an owned
 * property adds sub_08026C6C(id) to that army's income and bumps one counter
 * per kind. Terrain 8 (the HQ) records its cell instead of counting.
 *
 * The map is reached through a local overlay because gUnknown_08499590 is
 * declared `u8 *`: unk00/unk02 are the width and height, +0x1432 is the cell
 * array and +0x417a the per-row start table, which is the same +0x1432 /
 * rowOffset pair sub_080253B0 and sub_08058A2C use.
 *
 * The case bodies are emitted in SOURCE order, and the ROM's block order is
 * 8, 14, 20, 6, 10, 11 -- which is why the switch is written that way rather
 * than in ascending case order. The jump table itself is ascending regardless.
 *
 * The `lsls #0x18` on `b & 0xe0` before the zero test is the u8 local `t`, and
 * `lsrs #0x1d` on that same shifted value is `t >> 5`: read the pair as
 * `(u32)x << 24 >> 29`, a net right shift of 5, not as a mask plus a shift. */
