/* Four readouts worth keeping.
 *
 * 1. `again` IS A REAL VARIABLE, not a `do { } while (0)` wrapper. It is set to
 *    0 at the top of the body and tested at the bottom; agbcc has no global
 *    constant propagation, so the `movs r6,#0` / `cmp r6,#0; bne` pair survives
 *    even though nothing that lives ever stores 1 into it. The control-code
 *    arm's `again = 1; continue;` is what the ROM's lone `b <loop top>` is:
 *    `continue` in a `do`/`while` jumps to the TEST, jump.c threads that
 *    through the now-known-true test back to the top, and flow analysis then
 *    deletes the dead `movs r6,#1`.
 *
 * 2. THE TERMINATOR IS THE `else`, not the leading `if`. `proc->unk08 = 0` is
 *    emitted LAST, after the whole glyph path and immediately before the loop
 *    test, with the glyph path ending in `b <test>` -- that is gcc's
 *    then/`b end`/else layout, so the source tests `c != 0` and puts the store
 *    in the else. Written `if (c == 0) { store; } else if (...)` the store goes
 *    inline behind a `bne` and 86 of 144 bytes move, at an exact size.
 *
 * 3. `case 0:` SHARES `default:`, and that is the whole reason the dispatch
 *    carries `cmp #0x69; ble <default>`. A two-case switch never emits the
 *    low-bound test (wave 37, W37-A) -- with only {0x69, 0x6c} the tree is a
 *    two-node chain and agbcc emits just the two equality tests, 4 bytes
 *    short. A third node BELOW 0x69 makes it a two-children root, and its
 *    `cmp #0; beq` folds away only because the label it jumps to IS the
 *    default label; given its own body (probed with `case 0x21: break;`) the
 *    test survives instead. This is wave 28's W28-B rule, and the case VALUE
 *    is unobservable beyond being < 0x69.
 *
 * 4. THE TWO `+ 6` ARMS ARE ORDERED 0x6c THEN 0x69. Written the other way
 *    round agbcc cross-jumps the identical bodies into one and emits
 *    `beq; beq; <default>; <shared +6>`; in source order 0x6c-first the last
 *    dispatch test falls through into the 0x6c body and the 0x69 body is
 *    reached by the `beq`, which is the ROM's layout. */
