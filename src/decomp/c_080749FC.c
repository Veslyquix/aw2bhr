/* The proc struct and the `const u8 *` at +0x2c are c_08074AAC.c's, which is
 * what starts this proc; the byte it points at is a SIGNED id (`ldrb` then an
 * explicit `lsls #0x18; asrs #0x18`) indexing the 0x30-byte gUnknown_08615194
 * records for an (x, y) pair.
 *
 * `p` has to be its OWN statement.  The `ldr r3, =gUnknown_08615194` is the
 * table's address constant and agbcc emits it at the head of the statement
 * that first references the table: fold the `proc->unk_2c` load into that
 * statement and the pool `ldr` moves ahead of it, leave the subscript inline
 * in the call arguments and the pool `ldr` sinks past the whole (s8) cast.
 * The ROM has it between the two, which is one statement boundary and 6 bytes.
 * Same lever as sub_08043AC0 in the 0x08043000 block.
