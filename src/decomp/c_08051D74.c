/* MATCHED, first draft. The slot teardown the sub_08051BEC / sub_08051F4C
 * install family calls: clear the entry's unk00, raise the per-slot flag in
 * gUnknown_02029B80, and if the entry still holds a live proc id, retire it.
 *
 * The entry address is written out in full at each of the four uses rather than
 * bound to a `struct Unk02029A10 *` local. That is measured, not style: a
 * pointer local reverses the order of the two offset terms, emitting `a * 0xb4`
 * before `b * 0x24` where the ROM has the pool word first, then `b * 0x24`,
 * then `a * 0xb4`. The matched sub_08051BEC has the same shape from the same
 * inline spelling.
 *
 * sub_080153F0 returns `bool8` -- copied from its promoted definition, not
 * re-derived -- which is what makes the test a bare `lsls #0x18; cmp #0` with
 * no `lsrs`.
 *
 * sub_080156E8's second parameter is declared `void *` because this call site
 * passes the gUnknown_02029BA8 word with no narrowing; the callee narrows it to
 * u16 itself and its matched tail-callee uses it as an index. That
 * disagreement is real and is written up in include/unknown-functions.h. */
