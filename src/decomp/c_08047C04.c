/*
 * MATCHES. Wave 53 (W53-A), 832 bytes. Four try_match attempts plus two
 * permuter runs; the permuter supplied the last 8 bytes and nothing else could.
 *
 * NO .rodata to place. try_match reports two relocations naming different
 * symbols that resolve to the same address (+0x240 and +0x25c): that is the
 * finding below, not a difference in the ROM.
 *
 * gUnknown_0200FC50, gUnknown_0200FE50 and gUnknown_02010450 ARE ONE OBJECT.
 * Proof: `ldr r2, =0xFFFFF800; adds r4, r4, r2` reaches gUnknown_0200FC50 by
 * subtracting 0x800 from the gUnknown_02010450 already in r4. agbcc can only
 * fold the difference of two address constants when they are the SAME symbol,
 * so 0200FE50 is gUnknown_0200FC50 + 0x200 and 02010450 is
 * gUnknown_0200FC50 + 0x800. Spelling all three as one symbol also removes a
 * `-fforce-addr` .rodata word that three separate symbols force and the ROM
 * does not have, and it makes every offset fall on a 0x400 front/back pairing:
 * 0x100/0x500, 0x200/0x600, 0x240/0x640, 0x2c0/0x6c0, 0x800/0xc00, 0x880/0xc80.
 * gUnknown_02010450 stays declared in unknown-globals.h because other matched
 * functions use it; this one does not need it.
 *
 * Three spellings, each of which was worth bytes:
 *
 *  - The `?:` for sub_08014B0C's fourth argument must be an IF/ELSE STATEMENT.
 *    `a->unk21 == 0 ? 0 : a->unk1f + 1` is folded by the front end to
 *    `a->unk21 ? a->unk1f + 1 : 0`, which inverts the branch (`beq` to an
 *    out-of-line zero); the ROM has `bne` to an out-of-line `unk1f + 1`. The
 *    statement form is not folded, and it also moves argument 3's
 *    `ldr r2, [r6]` to AFTER the merge, which is where the ROM has it.
 *
 *  - The zero arm is `v = a->unk21`, not `v = 0`. The ROM copies the just-tested
 *    byte (`adds r3, r0, #0`) rather than materialising the constant, and CSE
 *    will not turn a `const_int 0` into that copy on its own -- the source has
 *    to name the value.
 *
 *  - `v` must be `s16`, not `int`. That one token swapped r5 and r6 across the
 *    whole tail (the gUnknown_08499578 pointer and the 0x8000 constant) and was
 *    worth 9 of the last 17 bytes. Found by the permuter.
 *
 * And the last 8: `base = 0x100;` INSIDE loop 1, binding the first source
 * offset to a local before the call rather than writing the constant inline.
 * Loop 1 and loop 2 are the same shape and the same source text, yet the ROM
 * allocates them differently -- loop 1 has the +0x500 giv in r7 and the
 * 0x060139C0 pool word in r5, loop 2 has them the other way round. Any draft
 * that writes the two loops identically gets loop 2's allocation for both. The
 * extra pseudo created at the top of loop 1's body is what flips the
 * strength-reduced givs' tie-break back. Same family as the wave-17 comma
 * anchor, but the anchor here is a CONSTANT bound to a local, and it is the
 * only thing in ~23,000 permuter iterations that moved those 8 bytes.
