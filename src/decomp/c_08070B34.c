 * The entry guard is one three-term condition and the whole body is its `if` --
 * there is no early return, which is why the ident test's `bne` and the
 * priority test's `bhi` share one exit label. `mplayInfo->ident` is RELOADED
 * for the `++` rather than held in a local (contrast sub_08070640): the branchy
 * guard sits between the test and the increment.
 *
 * The two track loops are one `while` with a two-term guard followed by a
 * second that continues from the same i and track. The duplicated exit test at
 * the top of the first loop is agbcc's loop rotation and must not be authored.
 *
 * REMAINING DIFF, all of it r0-vs-r1 on the SECOND operand of a compare or an
 * `and`, plus the emission order of the `movs rD, #imm` that feeds it:
 *   +0x20  ROM `ldr r1,[r5,#0x2c]; movs r0,#0x40; ldrb r1,[r1]; ands r0,r1`
 *          candidate `ldr r0,[r5,#0x2c]; ldrb r1,[r0]; movs r0,#0x40; ands r0,r1`
 *   +0x38  ROM copies songHeader->priority to r2 BEFORE loading
 *          mplayInfo->priority; the candidate loads both, then copies.
 *   +0x64  ROM `ldrb r1,[r7]` in the loop preheader; candidate `ldrb r0,[r7]`.
 *   +0x7a  ROM `mov r1,r8; str r1,[r4,#0x20]`; candidate uses r0.
 *   +0xa2  ROM `movs r1,#0; mov r8,r1`; candidate uses r0.
 *   +0xc2  ROM `movs r0,#0x80` BEFORE `ldrb r1,[r7,#3]`; candidate after.
 * The instruction stream, the branch targets, the loop rotation, the store
 * order in the body and the single pool word are all already byte-exact.
