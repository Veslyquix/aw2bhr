 * the step and the frame count are both dropped to zero, i.e. the motion is
 * applied instantly.

 * The record is a `struct Unk56E28` local, which is what produces the broken
 * address chain (`mov r0, sp; strh; adds r0, #2; strh; add r0, sp, #4; ...`):
 * taking the struct's address forces the stores through a register base rather
 * than sp displacements. Three of its seven members are literal zeros sharing
 * one `movs r1, #0`. */
