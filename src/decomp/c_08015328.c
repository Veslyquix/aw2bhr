/* Tears a gUnknown_03001470 slot down: clear its script pointer, run the
 * slot's +0x0c callback with gUnknown_03001FBC pointed at this slot, and if
 * flag bit 1 is set release the sprite the slot owns.
 *
 * gUnknown_03001FBC is saved and restored around the callback exactly as
 * sub_08015224/sub_0801527C do it, and for the same reason the `ldrh`/`strh`
 * pair is plain rather than `ldrsh`: an s16 read whose only use is an s16
 * store is a pure HImode move.
 *
 * The slot index is used BOTH ways and the two shift results are both live:
 * `lsrs` (zero-extended) is what `gUnknown_03001FBC = a` stores, `asrs`
 * (sign-extended) is what the array subscript and sub_080168BC need. That is
 * PROMOTE_MODE on an s16 parameter, not two variables.
 *
 * `(s16)` on the u16 member ->unk26 folds into the `ldrsh` and costs nothing,
 * unlike the same cast on a parameter or local; retyping the member is not
 * needed and would touch its other users.
