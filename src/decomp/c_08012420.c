#include "hardware.h"

/* The VBlank flush: every display register that has an IWRAM shadow, pushed to
 * the hardware in one straight line. 364 bytes, no branches, no calls.
 *
 * The statement ORDER here is the ROM's, and it is readable straight off the
 * absolute-address arithmetic rather than guessed: MOSAIC is loaded as a pool
 * word and the four BGxCNT writes come off it with `subs r1, #0x44` and three
 * `adds r1, #2`, which only happens if MOSAIC is written first. Every store is
 * to a volatile lvalue, so agbcc may not reorder them.
 *
 * Six of the source globals are volatile, and both halves of that were found
 * here rather than assumed -- see the notes in hardware.h and on
 * gUnknown_03002B20 in unknown-globals.h. Without them this comes out 16 bytes
 * short: the eight scroll writes share one load of each origin instead of
 * reloading it, and the last two register addresses get CSEd against the
 * leftover BGxOFS cursor instead of being loaded as fresh pool words.
