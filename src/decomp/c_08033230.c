 * NEEDS ITS .rodata POOL WORDS PLACED: 0x08090D6C, 0x08090D70, 0x08090D74,
 * holding &gUnknown_03003F70, &gUnknown_0849B018 and &gUnknown_0849B060.
 * They are agbcc's own -fforce-addr address constants and the honest spelling
 * reproduces all three, in order, from the loop's register pressure. Note the
 * SPLIT: the same three globals are also read AFTER the loop through a plain
 * `ldr rN,=sym` with no ROM word (gUnknown_03003F70 at 0x080333F4), and agbcc
 * decides that per reference by itself -- do not try to spell either side.
 *
 * THE DEAD `ldrb` BEFORE EVERY `strb` IS THE VOLATILE TELL, NOT A SOURCE
 * FEATURE. struct Unk0849B018's unk09 and unk0a[] are already declared
 * volatile in unknown-globals.h on exactly this evidence, so the plain
 * `&=` / `|=` / `= K` spellings emit it for free. Reading those loads as real
 * code is how this function would have cost a wave.
 *
 * The switch on gUnknown_03003F70[0x18] is a real `switch`, not an else-chain:
 * both `cmp`s sit back-to-back with the DEFAULT body inline behind them and
 * the two case bodies after it. Each case repeats the whole statement; agbcc
 * cross-jumps the common suffix from `movs r2,#0` onwards, which is why only
 * the `movs r1,#K` differs between them. The `(unk1e & 0xe)` else-arm shares
 * its tail with the `> 0xdf` block the same way.
 *
 * `proc->unk64 == 0` really is tested twice -- once as the outer guard and
 * again before Proc_GotoScript. agbcc cannot fold the second test because
 * sub_080315E8 clobbers memory in between, so the reload is not evidence of
 * a different structure.
 *
 * gUnknown_030030E0 is written through `.raw`, not `.bits`: the ROM clears
 * bits 0..4 with one pooled 0xffe0 and ORs 0x1f, and struct BlendCnt declares
 * those five as SEPARATE 1-bit fields, which would be five read-modify-writes.
 * `& ~0x1f` would have pooled 0xffffffe0; the ROM's word is 0x0000ffe0. */
