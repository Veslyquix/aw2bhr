/* Wave 85 (W85-D). Two constructs, both imported from the promoted twin
 * src/decomp/c_08050E08.c, which closed this exact residual class in wave 63:
 *
 * 1. The tail: each u16 memory operand of the two call additions is bound to an
 *    int local INSIDE the addition (mem_x/mem_y). That preserves the ldrh,
 *    gives the operand SImode precision and keeps the s16 local's explicit sign
 *    extension AHEAD of the load -- the ROM's order. Recovers both missing
 *    lsls/asrs pairs (wave 34/36/59 residual).
 *
 * 2. The middle: the cell address is bound E08-style with the k term FIRST --
 *    new_var = &((...)((u8 *)row) + (k * 4 + col * 0x10))->unk00 -- and the row
 *    address itself is spelled OFFSET-FIRST, BASE-LAST (gUnknown_03004580[a][1]
 *    * 0x30 + (u32)tbl), which is what turns the subscript spelling's
 *    `add r1, r6, r1` into the ROM's `add r1, r1, r6`. Same principle as the
 *    E7A8 entry byte-offset sum: the ROM adds the base last. */
