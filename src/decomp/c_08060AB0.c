/* MATCHED (wave 60, W60-E), 668 bytes, size exact.
 *
 * PROMOTION NOTE: trymatch reports `relocs: name different symbols that resolve
 * to the same address` at +0x028 and +0x1d0 -- the documented false mismatch --
 * and this function's data/promoted.json entry needs
 *     "rodata": ["0x0816DAD8", "0x0816DADC"]
 * before tools/split_rodata.py and tools/gen_lds.py are re-run.
 *
 * The AI's unit-production pick. Loop A finds the type class with the highest
 * remaining demand in the volatile gUnknown_02029C20 table, loop B scores every
 * buildable type against that class through three sub_08043070 probes, loop C
 * strikes out types whose demand is below their gUnknown_03004640 score, and
 * loop D picks the best survivor and buys it if the army can afford it and the
 * purchase stays under the two gUnknown_085766E0 ceilings.
 *
 * THE TWO RETRIES ARE `goto`s, NOT LOOP STATEMENTS, and that is the whole shape
 * of the function rather than a stylistic choice. Written as `for (;;)` with
 * `continue`/`break` the two back edges become NOTE_INSN_LOOP_BEG loops, and
 * loop.c then hoists `&TAB->v[pick]` and `&gUnknown_085D5ABC` into a preheader
 * the ROM does not have -- worth a spilled 4-byte frame slot, a `b` into a
 * rotated loop top, and the LOSS of the -fforce-addr word at 0x0816DADC, since
 * -fforce-addr and LICM are the same decision (see the W51-J chapter in
 * docs/agbcc-codegen.md). `goto` emits no loop notes, so nothing is hoisted and
 * the address constants are materialised where the ROM materialises them.
 * Measured: the `for (;;)` spelling is `sub sp, #0x2c`, this one is `#0x28`.
 *
 * `x` IS ONE VARIABLE shared by loop A's running maximum and loop D's, and the
 * live ranges overlap across the retry edge: `movs r7,#0` appears exactly twice,
 * at function entry and at loop D, and a `goto retry` re-enters loop A with
 * whatever loop D left behind. The entry one is the DECLARATION INITIALISER --
 * that is why it sits ahead of the gUnknown_030046C0.unk06 test rather than
 * after it.
 *
 * The `? :` on sub_08043070's fifth argument is NOT a `? :`. The ROM duplicates
 * the whole gUnknown_08499598 subscript and both `ldrb`s into each arm and
 * cross-jumps only from `str r2,[sp]` onward, which an argument-position
 * COND_EXPR cannot produce -- gcc evaluates that argument into one pseudo and
 * the other arguments outside the branch. Two full calls in an if/else is what
 * gives it, the same reading src/decomp/c_08038C98.c records for its own pair.
 *
 * `gUnknown_02029C20` is declared `extern u8 []` because src/decomp/c_0806171C.c
 * needs `gUnknown_02029C20 + 0x34` in bytes; it is really a volatile u16 table
 * indexed 1..24. The file-local view struct is mandatory and a `volatile u16 *`
 * cast is NOT a substitute -- the dead `ldrh` in front of each `strh` needs a
 * COMPONENT_REF root (the W50-A / W56-I chapters in docs/agbcc-codegen.md).
 * sub_08062C94 reaches the same symbol the same way.
 *
 * The pool words at 0x0816DAD8 and 0x0816DADC are agbcc's own -fforce-addr
 * address constants for gUnknown_030046C0 and gUnknown_085D5ABC, verified
 * against baserom.gba by W49-E; the honest spelling emits both, and the SECOND
 * reference to each (gUnknown_030046C0 at the success store, gUnknown_085D5ABC
 * at the unk1b test) comes out as an ordinary inline pool word, exactly as in
 * the ROM.
 *
 * `cost` is `x*5` then `lsls #0x11; lsrs #0x10` -- a net left shift of one under
 * a u16 truncation, i.e. `(u16)(x * 10)`, authored as a multiply into a `u16`
 * local so shorten_binary_op folds it into the ROM's two instructions.
 *
 * Loop C's `subs r5,#1; cmp r5,#0; bge` is check_dbra_loop on the ASCENDING
 * source loop below, and `movs r6,#0` before it is LICM hoisting the store's
 * constant -- neither is authored.
 *
 * Spill slots follow declaration order (W50-A): `thr` at [sp,#0x1c] then `v` at
 * [sp,#0x20], so those two declarations must stay in that order.
 *
 * struct Unk085766E0's unk21 and unk23 were carved for this function; see the
 * comments beside them in include/unknown-globals.h, which also record that
 * they ALIAS the 12-byte row table this same pointer carries at +0x14. */
