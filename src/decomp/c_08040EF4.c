/* Wave 80 (W80-C). Two of the three residual facts were SOURCE CONSTRUCTS,
 * and both are fixed below; see the tail comment for what remains.
 *
 * 1. The shared base is `proc->unk42 + (proc->unk3e - 0x10)`, NOT
 *    `proc->unk42 - 0x10 + proc->unk3e`. gcc 2.95 fold's `associate:` rule
 *    rewrites `(VAR - CON) + ARG1` into `VAR + (ARG1 - CON)`, so the old
 *    spelling was evaluated as unk42 + (unk3e - 16): address of unk42
 *    computed, then `ldrh unk3e; subs #16`, then the deferred `ldrh unk42`
 *    and the add. The ROM evaluates unk42, subtracts 16, THEN loads unk3e
 *    (`ldrh; subs #16; ldrh; adds`). The mirror rule `ARG0 + (VAR - CON)`
 *    -> `(ARG0 - CON) + VAR` produces exactly that from the spelling used
 *    here. A `(s16)` cast on `unk42 - 0x10` also blocks the reassociation
 *    (measured) but its narrowing survives, +4 bytes.
 *
 * 2. `u`'s add is `adds r5, r5, r0` -- the Div term is the FIRST operand,
 *    yet its sign extension is emitted AFTER the base. Writing `(s16)Div(..)
 *    + base` in one expression puts the sext before the base (W78's 90.9%
 *    regression) because the cast is expanded with its operand. Binding the
 *    Div result to an int `d` and the base to a local in the statement
 *    AFTER the second Div (wave 66 bound it BEFORE, which is what crossed
 *    the Div and spilled y) gives: call, base, sext(d), add(d, base). Frame
 *    stays 12 bytes.
 *
 * x is s16 and y is not: the ROM keeps `x << 16` on the stack and derives
 * both an `asrs` (the OR into the attribute word) and an `lsrs` (the u16
 * argument of sub_0802BD54) from it, which only a signed halfword object
 * does. `s != 0 ? s : 2` is written out twice (two identical
 * `movs r1,#2; cmp; beq; mov r1,rS` blocks). */
