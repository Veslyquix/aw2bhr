/* CgbOscOff. A `switch`, not an if-chain: the ROM's `cmp #2; beq / cmp #2; bgt`
 * binary-search dispatch is what agbcc emits for a switch over 1..3 with a
 * default, and the three tails are merged by cross-jumping -- case 1 falls into
 * the shared `movs r0,#0x80; strb` after `adds r1,#2`, cases 2 and default share
 * `movs r0,#8; strb; adds r1,#4`, and case 3 joins at the final `strb` alone.
 * That merging is why each arm materialises only its own register base. */
