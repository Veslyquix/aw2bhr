/* Promoted from assembly; each function below is byte-for-byte

#include "hardware.h"

/* The display-state snapshot: every shadow that sub_08012420 pushes to the
 * hardware, copied into a parallel set of symbols. 824 bytes, 43 statements,
 * no branches and no calls -- the emitted store order IS the source order,
 * because none of the 88 addresses is reachable by arithmetic from any other
 * (they are all distinct relocations, so unlike sub_08012420 there is no
 * absolute-address chain to read the ordering off, and none is needed).
 *
 * Six of the copies pack two shadows into one word as `lo | (hi << 16)`, and
 * the four window bounds go out together as a single 64-bit OR. That last one
 * is what makes the function want three high registers: the four operands are
 * volatile, so combine cannot fold each `ldrh` into the DImode lowpart and
 * every term leaves a `adds rN, r4, #0` copy behind. See the notes on
 * gUnknown_030020B0 and gUnknown_03001FF8 in unknown-globals.h -- the volatile
 * qualifiers here are load-bearing and were each read off the codegen.
