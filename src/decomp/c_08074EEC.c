 *
 * The table element is re-`ldrh`d every iteration, which is why
 * gUnknown_0861433C must NOT be declared const: the `strh` goes through a
 * pointer GCC cannot see past, so a non-const global is reloaded, while a const
 * one is hoisted into the preheader and takes a callee-saved register with it.
 * Counter 4..0 with `bge` is the ascending `for (i = 0; i < 5; i++)`. */
