 * THE ZERO IS A SEPARATE STATEMENT, and that is the whole difficulty. The ROM
 * order is `movs r0,#0` / `ldrh r5,[r4,#0x1a]` / `strh r0,[r4,#0x18]` -- the
 * constant materialised, THEN the load, THEN the store. Neither natural
 * two-statement spelling produces it: `saved = ...; a1->unk18 = 0;` emits
 * ldrh/movs/strh and `a1->unk18 = 0; saved = ...;` emits movs/strh/ldrh, both
 * measured with compile_probe. agbcc runs no post-reload scheduler here, so
 * the insn order IS the source order, and the only source that puts the
 * constant's own insn ahead of the load is one where the stored value is a
 * variable assigned on its own line. */
