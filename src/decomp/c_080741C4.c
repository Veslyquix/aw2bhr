/* A subset of sub_0806EB5C's screen-init run, which is where every type here
 * comes from -- same two Decompress calls, same palette, same tail.  The one
 * thing that differs is the first destination: sub_0806EB5C hard-codes
 * 0x06008000 where this computes the char base out of the BG3 control shadow.
 * `ldr` + `lsls #0x1c; lsrs #0x1e` is the bitfield read of `bits.chr_block`
 * whatever the container, and `<< 0xe` scales it by the 16 KB char block.
 *
 * Wave 53 (W53-A) RETYPES this from `void sub_080741C4(void)`. The body reads
 * no argument register, so nullary was the honest body-side reading, but the
 * caller-side evidence is decisive the other way: sub_0804A260 sets r0, r1 and
 * r2 to 0 with three separate `movs #0` immediately before the `bl`. An
 * argument already in the right register costs nothing, but a literal 0 never
 * does, so there are three parameters and this body ignores all three. The
 * three unused ints change nothing here -- re-verified byte-for-byte with
 * trymatch, 72 bytes, relocs match -- and sub_0807420C in this file is
 * untouched.
