/* MATCHED, wave 55 (W55-E), two attempts. A debug CO/army editor page.
 *
 * PROMOTION REQUIRES THE WHOLE .rodata BLOB PLACED -- 105 words,
 * 0x08091154 through 0x080912F4 inclusive, contiguous. Run
 * `python tools/trymatch.py sub_0803D9FC --diff` and paste the "rodata": [...]
 * list it prints into this function's data/promoted.json entry, then re-run
 * tools/split_rodata.py and tools/gen_lds.py before building. trymatch reports
 * `relocs: name different symbols that resolve to the same address`, which is
 * the match verdict, not a defect.
 *
 * THE ONE THING THAT COST AN ATTEMPT: the switch selector. The ROM does
 * `ldrh r0,[r7,#0x20]; subs r0,#1; lsls r0,#0x10; asrs r0,#0x10` -- an
 * UNSIGNED halfword load followed by a sign-extend of the DIFFERENCE. Plain
 * `switch (proc->unk20 - 1)` on an `s16` field gives `ldrsh` and no shift pair.
 * The `(s16)` cast on the whole subtraction is what produces both halves: the
 * narrowing lets GCC shorten the load to `ldrh` (only the low 16 bits survive)
 * and forces the explicit re-widening afterwards. Note this does NOT contradict
 * the field being `s16` -- the two cursor tests above load the same field both
 * ways in one statement (`ldrh` for the value that is stored back, `ldrsh` for
 * the comparison), which is exactly what an `s16` produces.
 *
 * See NOTES.md beside this file for how every symbol was resolved; the short
 * version:
 *
 *  - NONE of the nine gUnknown_080912xx "globals" are globals. They are STRING
 *    LITERALS, and the four gUnknown_080911xx are tables of them. All verified
 *    against baserom.gba. Nothing here is declared in include/unknown-globals.h
 *    and nothing should be.
 *  - gUnknown_080912E8/EC/F0/F4 ARE -fforce-addr words, holding 0x03003FC0,
 *    0x08499598, 0x03004080 and 0x03002EE0. The honest spelling names the real
 *    object and agbcc rebuilds the extra indirection itself.
 *  - 0x03002EE0 is `gpKeySt`, NOT an unnamed global. include/unknown-globals.h
 *    records that wave 20 invented a `gUnknown_03002EE0` for it and the SPLIT
 *    build caught it. Checked before writing, deliberately.
 *  - sub_0803D990 was already promoted (src/decomp/c_0803D990.c); its prototype
 *    was copied from the definition, not guessed from the call sites.
 *
 * The parameter is modelled as a plain struct rather than a PROC: the two
 * fields live at +0x1e and +0x20, which is INSIDE this tree's PROC_HEADER
 * (0x00..0x28), so it is not a proc in the c_08073E0C sense. Byte-neutral here
 * either way; flagging it because I could not prove it. */
