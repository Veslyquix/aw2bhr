/* The first argument is a POINTER into ROM, not the `s32` this was promoted
 * with, and sub_08078358 is decisive rather than merely suggestive: it walks
 * four 4-byte records based at gUnknown_08615974 and calls
 * `sub_08074AAC(&record[i][2], parent)` -- an INTERIOR address formed as
 * `gUnknown_08615974 + 2 + i*4`, which no integer parameter would be spelled
 * as. The other three callers agree: sub_0807831C passes a word loaded out of
 * gUnknown_0861500C, and sub_08078440 / sub_08078454 pass gUnknown_08615984 and
 * gUnknown_08615988 by name. Everything so passed is a 0xFF-terminated u8 id
 * list (checked against baserom.gba), hence `const u8 *`.
 * Byte-neutral -- the value is only `str`-ed -- and re-verified with trymatch. */
