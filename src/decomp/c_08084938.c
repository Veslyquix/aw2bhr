/* sub_080848FC's shape run twice back to back over two disjoint id ranges
 * against sub_0803CB24's bitset. The two loops are not symmetric in the
 * assembly -- the first reaches the shared `movs r0, #0` with `beq` and the
 * second skips it with `bne` -- because jump.c cross-jumped the two identical
 * `return FALSE;` tails onto the second one, which is where the block happened
 * to land. Nothing in the source distinguishes them.
 *
 * The `lsls r0, r0, #0x18` at both call sites is what re-typed sub_0803CB24's
 * return from `int` to `u8`; see include/unknown-functions.h. */
