/* gUnknown_08580934 is reached through agbcc's own -fforce-addr word (the ROM
 * word at 0x0816E1A4, which holds 0x08580934), hence the `ldr r5,=..;
 * ldr r4,[r5]; ldr r0,[r4]` triple. Naming the global is what produces it.
 *
 * The delay loop really is empty -- gcc 2.9 has no dead-loop elimination, so
 * it survives -O2. But it has to be spelled with the guard and the counter as
 * TWO locals and an explicit `if`: `adds r2, r0, #0` is a copy the allocator
 * did not coalesce, and every one-variable spelling of the same countdown
 * (`while (n != 0) n--`, `for (i = 0; i < unk08; i++)`, `for (i = unk08;
 * i != 0; i--)`, with a fresh name or a reused one) coalesces it away and
 * comes out one instruction short. Probed, all five.
 *
 * The `v` round-trip in the last loop is a caller-side cast, not a claim about
 * unk32's type. Written `gUnknown_08580934->unk32 |= 0xff`, shorten_binary_op
 * narrows the OR to QImode, `fold` sees an all-ones mask and collapses the
 * whole statement to `strb -1` -- two instructions where the ROM has four.
 * Going through an int keeps the read-modify-write; reading through `(u8 *)`
 * is what makes it `ldrb` rather than the `ldrsb` the s8 member would give.
 * Probed: `|=` folds, `x = x | 0xff` folds, and a volatile cast drops the OR
 * instead. */
