/* MATCHED byte-for-byte, wave 43 (W43-C), first attempt.
 *
 * The block-sender's per-frame tick, and the consumer half of the proc
 * sub_0803376C builds: unk2a is the block count, unk2c the cursor, unk24 the
 * write pointer, unk2e the tail byte count and unk2f the 0..100 percentage.
 * Every field lines up with sub_0803376C's initialisation, which is what
 * settles this struct -- a producer and a consumer agreeing independently,
 * rather than any single access here.
 *
 * `sub_08030B00(...) != -1` re-narrows the callee's `s16` return with
 * `lsls #0x10; asrs #0x10`; that is the declared width, not a cast at this
 * use. The -1 arrives as `movs r1,#1; rsbs r1,r1,#0` because `cmp` takes only
 * an 8-bit immediate -- it is the constant, not arithmetic.
 *
 * The two comparisons over the SAME pair of u16 fields come out with
 * different signedness and both are correct as written. The guard is `bge`
 * (signed) because `proc->unk2a - 1` is int arithmetic that can reach -1; the
 * tail is `blo` (unsigned) because both operands are bare zero-extended
 * `ldrh` loads and agbcc knows they are non-negative. Nothing in the source
 * distinguishes them, so this is not a lever -- it is worth recording only
 * because a signed/unsigned mismatch usually IS a type signal and here it is
 * not.
 *
 * `100 * proc->unk2c / proc->unk2a` is signed division, so agbcc emits a call
 * to __divsi3. That is a libgcc helper, NOT a subsystem function -- never
 * declare it.
 *
 * The copy loop reloads proc->unk24 after the byte store because the store
 * goes through a pointer that could alias the field. Two statements are what
 * the ROM has; `*p++ = v` keeps the value in a register and does not match. */

/* MATCHED byte-for-byte, wave 43 (W43-C), by decomp-permuter. It had been
 * parked at 92.6% since wave 33, with waves 33 and 34 both concluding there
 * was "no untested source-level lever". There was one.
 *
 * THE ANSWER TO THE PARK'S OPEN QUESTION. The residual was r4/r5 swapped and
 * nothing else: the ROM keeps `n` (the rounded block count) in r5 and `m`
 * (the `b & 0x7f` remainder) in r4, and every hand draft put them the other
 * way round. The earlier waves correctly ruled out declaration order, `u8 m`,
 * and swapping the two computation statements. The lever is none of those --
 * it is BINDING THE MASK CONSTANT 0x7f TO ITS OWN LOCAL, ASSIGNED BEFORE THE
 * EARLY-RETURN GUARD.
 *
 * Why it works, and it is the allocno-priority story the park was reaching
 * for. agbcc's global.c ranks allocnos by roughly
 * `floor_log2(n_refs) * freq / live_length` and hands out the low registers
 * first. `n` has four references (two defs, two uses) against `m`'s three, so
 * `n` outranks `m` and takes r4 -- which is exactly what every hand draft
 * produced. Hoisting 0x7f into `mask` adds a THIRD allocno whose live range
 * starts at the top of the function and reaches past the guard to `b & mask`,
 * which shifts the live-length denominators enough to invert the n/m
 * ordering. The constant still folds into `movs r4,#0x7f`, so the extra local
 * costs zero instructions.
 *
 * Two things generalise:
 *   - Wave 34's conclusion that "statement order controls INSTRUCTION order
 *     and does not touch the ALLOCATION at all" is RIGHT, and it is precisely
 *     why the lever had to be a new VALUE rather than a reordering. When a
 *     pure slot-wrong residual survives every reordering, add a live range;
 *     do not keep shuffling the ones already there.
 *   - The permuter earned its keep on exactly the case the brief predicts for
 *     it (order-wrong and slot-wrong), at 108 bytes -- well under the "above
 *     256 bytes" guidance, which is about when to REACH for it, not a floor
 *     below which it stops working. Iteration 402, ~5 minutes, 4 threads.
 *
 * Prototype, settled in wave 33 and unchanged: the `int` return comes from
 * both exits setting r0 (`movs r0,#1; rsbs r0,r0,#0` and `movs r0,#0`), which
 * a void function does not do; the `u8` fourth parameter from the
 * `lsls r3,#24; lsrs r6,r3,#24` at entry. */
