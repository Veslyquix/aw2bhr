/* MATCHED (wave 37, W37-Q4), three attempts.
 * Needs "rodata": ["0x08091384"] in data/promoted.json (the force-addr word
 * holding &gUnknown_084A0090).  Note the SECOND reference to that same global,
 * in the CpuFastSet arm, is a plain literal-pool `ldr` in the ROM; the honest
 * spelling reproduces both, so do not try to make them agree.
 *
 * Stages the slot's 0x180-byte tile blob into gUnknown_02017C50 and rewrites
 * it into the caller's buffer, forcing every zero 4bpp nibble to a non-zero
 * palette index (1 per nibble position) so nothing in the portrait is
 * transparent.  a3 is either a palette slot (<= 14, handed to sub_08043AA0)
 * or a raw CpuFastSet destination.
 *
 * Two spellings were the whole cost, and both refute a rule in the wave brief:
 *
 * 1. `v &= M; v |= B;` as TWO statements, not `v = (v & M) | B;`.  With `u16
 *    v` the single-expression form is narrowed to HImode by convert_to_integer
 *    and no truncation is emitted; the compound-assignment pair leaves the
 *    `lsls #0x10; lsrs #0x10` zero-extension after the OR, which the ROM has
 *    at nibbles 3, 2 and 1.  Nibble 0 is the single-expression form -- its
 *    result goes straight to the `strh`, and the ROM has no truncation there.
 *    (`int v` with explicit `(u16)` casts is a third, different answer: it
 *    also changes the mask constants to their sign-extended forms 0xFFFFF0FF
 *    /0xFFFFFF0F/0xFFFFFFF0, which the ROM does not use.)
 *
 * 2. The INNER loop counts UP in the source -- `for (i = 0; i < 16; i++)` --
 *    and check_dbra_loop reverses it.  `subs r2,#1; cmp r2,#0; bge` looks like
 *    a genuine descending loop and is not; writing it as `for (i = 15; i >= 0;
 *    i--)` is byte-for-byte identical EXCEPT that the two insns at the top of
 *    the outer body come out in the other order.  The reversal inserts the new
 *    `i = 15` init at the END of the inner preheader, i.e. AFTER the outer
 *    biv's `adds r3,r0,#1`; a genuinely descending source puts the init first.
 *    That was the last 4 bytes, and ~19,400 permuter iterations did not find
 *    it.
