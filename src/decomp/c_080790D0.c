/* MATCHED, wave 87 (W87-B).
 *
 * Wave 86 (W86-F) took this from 50.0% to 92.0% size-exact with the twin
 * sub_0807B360's "scale i, never the pointer" construct, leaving 18 bytes: the
 * two loop-invariant bases of loop 1 were emitted in the opposite order and
 * therefore traded registers.  Three things closed the rest, and the order
 * matters because each one only became visible once the previous was in place:
 *
 * 1. The two bases are SOURCE-LEVEL WALKERS, not compiler givs.  `src` and
 *    `dst` are bound before the inner loop and stepped by `src += 0x400;` /
 *    `dst += 0x100;` in the body.  This alone put SRC in the ROM's r5 and DST
 *    in r4.  Every attempt to reach the same order by BINDING the base to a
 *    local while the body still re-derived it -- W86-F's outer-body
 *    `q = (u8 *)(off + (int)p);`, the same bind in the inner for-init, and
 *    binding the whole address `q = (u8 *)(off + (int)p + j * 0x400);` inside
 *    the body -- is BYTE-IDENTICAL to the plain draft: cse folds a bind whose
 *    value the body recomputes.  A walker cannot be folded, because the
 *    increment makes the local the only carrier of the value.
 *
 * 2. `k = i * 0x800;` as its own statement ahead of `src`.  The ROM emits
 *    `lsls r0,r7,#0xb` at the TOP of the outer body and its consumer
 *    `adds r4,r0,r1` five insns later; that split is cse reusing a pseudo a
 *    separate earlier statement produced, and it is also what pushes p's copy
 *    off r0 onto the ROM's `mov r1,r8`.
 *
 * 3. The inner counter is DESCENDING IN THE SOURCE.  With `for (j = 0; j < 8;
 *    j++)` check_dbra_loop rewrites the init to `j = 7` but re-emits it
 *    IMMEDIATELY BEFORE the loop, so it always lands last in the preheader.
 *    The ROM has `movs r6,#7` in the MIDDLE, between `src` and `dst` -- only a
 *    source-level `j = 7` stays where it is written.  Addresses stay ascending
 *    because they are walkers and do not depend on j.
 *
 * Loop 2 keeps W86-F's scaled-index form; loops, pool and tail unchanged. */
