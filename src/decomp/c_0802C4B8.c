 * The incoming r0 is saved into r4 across the first call and re-emerges as
 * Proc_StartBlocking's second argument, so the parameter is the parent -- and
 * the first call takes NOTHING. That is read off the callee, not off the call
 * site: sub_080413E8's first instruction is `bl sub_0804138C`, and
 * sub_0804138C only stores 0 to gUnknown_030040A8, so no argument register is
 * consumed anywhere in the chain. A pass-through would be byte-identical here,
 * which is exactly why the readout has to come from the callee side.
 *
 * gUnknown_0849A02C is newly declared `const struct ProcCmd []`: sub_0802B3AC
 * and sub_0802B4D4 hand it straight to Proc_Find, and it is the 0x20-byte slot
 * immediately after gUnknown_0849A00C, which is already declared that way. */
