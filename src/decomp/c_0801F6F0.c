/* One neighbour step of the movement-range flood fill. Adds the cursor origin
 * gUnknown_0300409C to the (dx, dy) it is given, costs the destination cell,
 * and -- if the new cost beats what gUnknown_03003340 already holds and the
 * cell passes the four bounds/blocking tests -- writes a 4-byte {x, y, tag,
 * cost} record through the gUnknown_03003F64 queue cursor and records the cost.
 *
 * `idx` IS ASSIGNED INSIDE THE EXPRESSION, and that is the whole ordering fact.
 * As its own preceding statement it loads gUnknown_08499590 first; the ROM
 * loads gUnknown_084999C8 first, because that pointer is the OUTERMOST base of
 * the cost term and the map is only reached inside its index. Written as a
 * separate statement everything else is identical and the two pool words come
 * out swapped.
 *
 * The `&` operands are `unk2a & unk24[...]`, not the other way round: the ROM
 * materialises `&p->unk2a` (three instructions, since 0x2a is past the `ldrb`
 * displacement range) BEFORE the `lsrs #0x1e` that indexes unk24.
 *
 * `x` and `y` are u8 LOCALS -- shorten_compare narrows both bound tests to
 * unsigned char, which is where the `bhs` comes from; an int local gives the
 * signed `bge`. `v` is u16 and the two views of the same sum (`lsrs #0x10` for
 * the stored byte, `asrs #0x10` for the two signed compares) fall out of that
 * one declaration. */
