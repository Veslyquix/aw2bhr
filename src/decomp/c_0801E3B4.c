 * The shape is agbcc's balanced switch tree, not a chain of `if`s: it tests the
 * MIDDLE case (0x8000) first, then `bgt` to split the remaining two, which is
 * what `expand_end_case` emits once there are three or more cases over a dense
 * range. Written as if/else-if the compares come out in source order instead.
 * `bgt` rather than `bhi` makes the masked value signed, i.e. the parameter is
 * `int` -- and `adds r1, r0, #0` before the mask is the copy-then-use that says
 * the parameter is not narrower. */
