/* MATCHED -- wave 60 (W60-D).  512/512 bytes.
 *
 * PROMOTION REQUIREMENT (unchanged from the wave-56 park, and confirmed by
 * trymatch): this match needs its .rodata pool words PLACED.  The
 * data/promoted.json entry must carry
 *     "rodata": ["0x08090B74", "0x08090B78"]
 * and tools/split_rodata.py + tools/gen_lds.py must be re-run before building.
 * trymatch reports +0xe8/+0xec as "different symbols that resolve to the same
 * address" and calls it a match; that is the -fforce-addr address-constant
 * pool for gUnknown_03001470 and gUnknown_03001FBC, exactly as the wave-56
 * park predicted.
 *
 * HOW IT CLOSED, from the wave-56 park's 91.2% size-exact draft.  Three edits,
 * two of them found by decomp-permuter (shell tools/permute.py, run REPEATEDLY
 * with each round starting from the previous round's best.c: 91.2 -> 96.7 ->
 * 99.4 -> 99.8; a single long run from the draft found nothing, replicating
 * wave 59's 87.3 -> 94.3 -> 98.2 -> match):
 *
 *  1. THE `cell` LOCAL IS NOT IN THE ORIGINAL.  `terr[idx]` is read inline at
 *     both uses -- `(terr[idx] & 0xE0)` and `terr[idx] & 0x1F`.  The park's
 *     "NEXT THING TO TRY" note guessed this correctly: `cell` was the one extra
 *     live pseudo taking r4 ahead of `u`, and deleting it is what unwound the
 *     r3/r4/r5 rotation the park had classified as the whole residual.
 *
 *  2. `marks = 0x234A + map;` with the CONSTANT FIRST, not `map + 0x234A`.
 *
 *  3. THE TWO-CALL SUM MUST BE SPLIT, AND 978 EVALUATED FIRST:
 *         n = sub_08029978(u, 0);
 *         n = sub_08029A48(u, 0) + n;
 *     The single expression `sub_08029978(u,0) + sub_08029A48(u,0)` emits the
 *     right instruction shape but the WRONG call order.  Note this difference
 *     costs ZERO bytes -- both `bl`s encode as offset 0 plus a relocation -- so
 *     it is invisible in the byte score and only the reloc comparison catches
 *     it.  A 99.8%-identical candidate can still have two calls swapped.
 *
 *  4. `u8 flag`, NOT `int flag`.  This is the last two bytes and it is a
 *     general rule (written up in docs/agbcc-codegen.md).  sub_08029CB8's
 *     fourth parameter is `u8` -- and that is right, it agrees with the
 *     promoted definition in src/decomp/c_08029C38.c.  With an `int` local the
 *     int->u8 conversion at the call emits no instruction of its own (gcc
 *     proves it redundant, flag is 0 or 1) but it REORDERS the argument setup
 *     to `mov r3, ip ; mov r0, sp`, where the ROM has `mov r0, sp ; mov r3,
 *     ip`.  Declaring the local at the parameter's own width removes the
 *     conversion node and restores the order.
 *
 * A TRAP WORTH KNOWING (wave 60, W60-D): decomp-permuter's type randomizer
 * MUTATES PROTOTYPES inside its own expanded translation unit.  Its 99.8%
 * best.c had silently rewritten sub_08029CB8's fourth parameter from `u8` to
 * `int` -- which reproduces the ROM's argument order, but is a change we
 * cannot legally adopt, because the promoted body in src/decomp/c_08029C38.c
 * defines it `u8`.  The legal spelling with the SAME effect is the `u8 flag`
 * local above.  Always diff work/<fn>/permuter/base.c against include/ before
 * believing a permuter win: base.c is regenerated from best.c each round, so
 * once a prototype mutation is saved it is baked into every later round.
 *
 * STILL SETTLED FROM WAVE 56, do not re-derive:
 *  - `p7 = &gUnknown_03004007;` at the top of the loop body is LOAD-BEARING;
 *    it is the only reason sl holds the right symbol.  Its position does not
 *    matter, only its presence.
 *  - `n != 0 || m != 0` is the right spelling of the early-out, and the
 *    `if (m != 0)` arm really does zero `n` before sub_08029CB8.
 *  - the `marks[idx] == 0` arm (three calls, results discarded) must be the
 *    fall-through, and both arms are genuine source call sites.
 *  - `pt` is a 4-byte struct, so both member stores are SImode bitfield
 *    inserts on one stack word.
 *  - `t = u->unk03 * 2;` must be its own statement before `rows = map+0x417A`.
