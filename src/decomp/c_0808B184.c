 * call -- and that needs no `volatile`: the intervening `*dst = *src` may alias
 * `src`, so agbcc cannot reuse the first load.
 *
 * `bl _call_via_r3` is an ordinary indirect call with THREE arguments (the
 * register index counts them), and the `lsls #0x10; lsrs #0x10` after it is the
 * re-narrowing of that pointer's declared u16 return. */
