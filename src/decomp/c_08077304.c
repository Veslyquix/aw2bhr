/* MATCHED in wave 66 (W66-I). The two missing instructions diagnosed below
 * were the SAME mechanism at the two table-byte call sites: binding both
 * values to `register int arg asm("r2")` keeps each byte in r2 while agbcc
 * constructs argument 2, then emits the ROM's `adds r0, r2, #0` immediately
 * before the call. Fixing both also restored the ROM's r9/sl allocation.
 * Configured try_match verifies 796/796 bytes and equivalent relocations; the
 * promotion needs rodata 0x081CC5A0/5A4/5A8/5AC.
 *
 * HISTORICAL PARK (wave 54, W54-F) at 792/796 bytes -- FOUR bytes short, and the score
 * try_match prints (42.5%) is the positional artefact the brief warns about,
 * not a measure of how far this is. Everything in the function is derived and
 * byte-exact except ONE instruction and one register pair.
 *
 * REMAINING DIFF 1 -- the whole size difference, at +0x74, in the
 * `unk20 == NULL` arm:
 *
 *   ROM        adds r0, r2, #0 / adds r0, #0x3c / ldrb r2, [r0]
 *              ldr r4, =<forceaddr> / ldr r0, [r4] / ldr r1, [r0]
 *              lsls #0x1c / lsrs #0x1e / lsls #0xe / ldr r0, =0x060008C0
 *              adds r1, r1, r0 / adds r0, r2, #0 / movs r2, #1 / bl
 *   candidate  ... ldrb r0, [r0] ... ldr r1, [r4] / ldr r1, [r1] ...
 *              ldr r2, =0x060008C0 / adds r1, r1, r2 / movs r2, #1 / bl
 *
 * i.e. the ROM leaves the first argument in r2 and copies it into r0 after the
 * second argument is built, while this candidate coalesces it straight into r0
 * and the second argument uses r1 as its scratch. That is one `adds r0, r2, #0`
 * (2 bytes) plus the `.align` pad it costs the literal pool (2 more) -- the
 * -4 and the +0x74 first-difference are ONE fact, not two.
 *   Tried and made no difference: binding the byte to a fresh int local before
 *   the call (agbcc folds the local away and emits the identical stream).
 *
 * REMAINING DIFF 2 -- a high-register swap in the tail, size-neutral, about
 * eight bytes: the ROM puts the -fforce-addr word for gBG0TilemapBuffer in
 * `sb` and `&c` (the third CpuFastSet fill scalar) in `sl`; this candidate has
 * them the other way round, so every `mov rN, sb` reads `mov rN, sl`. Both
 * pseudos are created in the same preheader in the same order in both, so this
 * is allocno priority, not creation order.
 *
 * The permuter is NOT the tool here: the residual is a MISSING INSTRUCTION,
 * which docs/agbcc-codegen.md records as the one register-allocation shape it
 * cannot close. Fix diff 1 by hand first; diff 2 may well follow it, since
 * both point the same way (this candidate allocates one notch more tightly
 * than the ROM).
 *
 * EVERYTHING ELSE IS SETTLED AND SHOULD NOT BE RE-DERIVED:
 *  - The four pool words 0x081CC5A0/5A4/5A8/5AC are -fforce-addr words holding
 *    &gUnknown_0202FDFC, &gUnknown_03002B6C, &gBG0TilemapBuffer and
 *    &gUnknown_086145CE (read out of baserom.gba). Naming the objects directly
 *    reproduces every indirection level. A match needs
 *    "rodata": ["0x081CC5A0", "0x081CC5A4", "0x081CC5A8", "0x081CC5AC"].
 *  - gUnknown_085C77A0 is the 0x5c-stride record and struct Unk085C77A0
 *    already models unk18/unk3c[4]/unk40[4]; gUnknown_085C77DC is the SAME
 *    table 0x3c in (see the note added in include/unknown-globals.h).
 *  - `(s16)` on gUnknown_08615194[..].unk00 is what emits the `ldrsh`; the
 *    member stays u16 (wave 37: sign_extend of a mem:HI always folds to
 *    ldrsh, so the declared signedness is irrelevant).
 *  - unk10 and unk20 of struct Unk08615194 were carved out of filler here.
 *  - BOTH halfword store loops must bind the pointer global to a LOCAL first
 *    (W44-D). Written as `gBG0TilemapBuffer[0x29a + k]` the load is repeated
 *    inside the loop, strength reduction never fires and the loop stays
 *    ascending; bound to a local it collapses to the ROM's descending
 *    `strh / subs / subs / subs / cmp / bge`.
 *  - The two store loops and the unk40 scan need THREE DIFFERENT loop
 *    counters. Sharing one `i` gives it a live web spanning the calls, parks
 *    it in a callee-saved register and changes every register in both store
 *    loops (the W54-B fresh-name-per-site rule again).
 *  - The four CpuFastSet fill sources are plain `u32` scalars here, not the
 *    arrays W53-C describes: the value already lands in r4 and the address is
 *    materialised separately, which is the shape that chapter's array form
 *    exists to produce. Both a/b sites are byte-exact as written.
