/* Dispatch through a ROM table of nullary handlers, guarded by a clamp on the

 * counter held in a global record, then a call parameterised by it.
 *
 * The byte at +0x0b is struct Unk030040D8's unk07[4] -- a CONSTANT subscript, so
 * it folds into the `ldrb`/`strb` displacement and shows none of the
 * `adds rB,#7` member-array tell that a variable index would leave.
 *
 * `> 7` with the reset as the THEN arm, exactly as in sub_0802CF94: the `<= 7`
 * spelling emits the mirror branch. `bls` is UNSIGNED, agreeing with the u8.
 *
 * `bl _call_via_r0` with no argument register written before it -- r0 index is
 * the arity readout, so the table's entries are nullary.
