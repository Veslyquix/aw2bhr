/* A rectangular halfword blit into a 32-wide tilemap. `src` points at a header
 * whose low byte is the row width; the halfwords follow it, and each is biased
 * by `add` on the way out.
 *
 * Two things settle the register allocation, and wave 46 measured both:
 *  - The ROM reuses the `dst` PARAMETER as the row cursor. That is what forces
 *    the `adds r4, r0, #0` prologue copy: dst is then one pseudo live across
 *    the whole outer loop, so it takes a callee-saved register instead of
 *    staying in r0. A separate `row` local leaves dst in r0 (86 bytes, no
 *    prologue copy) and a `dst += x` in-place update coalesces base into dst.
 *  - `j` must be DECLARED BEFORE `i`. Declaration order sets the pseudo
 *    numbers, and the allocno tie-break follows them: with `i` first the two
 *    counters land in r3/r1, with `j` first they land in r1/r3 as the ROM has
 *    them. Same instruction stream either way. */
