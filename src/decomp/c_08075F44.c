/* MATCHED. NEEDS ITS POOL WORD PLACED: add "rodata": ["0x081CC584"] to this
 * function's data/promoted.json entry, then re-run tools/split_rodata.py and
 * tools/gen_lds.py before building. trymatch reports
 * `relocs: name different symbols that resolve to the same address` -- that
 * word is agbcc's own -fforce-addr copy of &gUnknown_0202FDFC, not a global.
 *
 * The one non-obvious spelling, and it was the whole difference from 98.3%:
 * the row stride is written as `<< 5`, NOT `* 32`. fold reorders a commutative
 * PLUS so that a MULT_EXPR operand comes first, so `x + y * 32` emits
 * `adds rD, rMUL, rX` while `x + (y << 5)` emits `adds rD, rX, rSHIFT`, which
 * is what the ROM has. Evaluation order is the same either way.
 *
 * gUnknown_0202FDFC is spelled honestly and referenced FOUR times, which is
 * what makes agbcc take the force-addr indirection (`ldr r2, =.LC0` once, then
 * `ldr r2, [r2]` again at the second group). The `(a + b) / 8` term is written
 * out TWICE rather than bound to a local: the ROM recomputes it after the
 * branch, which a single local cannot produce.
 *
 * The parameter stays `void *` (the header declares it that way and
 * c_0807614C.c passes its own proc type); the two +0x3c accesses are cast at
 * the use rather than bound to a typed local, because the local costs an extra
 * prologue copy in about half of these. */
