/* Starts the alpha-fade child and seeds it from the parent's +0x2c parity: the
 * two ternaries are one test each, both reloading +0x2c rather than sharing it.
 * The middle four statements are the same fade preamble as
 * src/decomp/c_0806B828.c, including `unk58 >> 3` computed once and reused for
 * the 0xe subtraction.
 *
 * The tail is the `.raw` half of gUnknown_030030E0, not `.bits`: the two target
 * GROUPS go through one HImode read-modify-write with pool masks
 * (`ldrh; ldr =0xFFE0; ands; orrs; ldr =0xE0FF; ands; orrs; strh`), which five
 * 1-bit field writes cannot produce -- a 5-bit group at bit 0 sits inside byte
 * 0, so get_best_mode would pick QImode and emit `ldrb`/`strb`. `effect` a few
 * lines above IS `.bits`, and is `ldrb` accordingly. This is the same split
 * documented for the 0806717C/08067300/0806A4DC family in hardware.h, and this
 * function is another member of it. The two raw writes merge into a single
 * ldrh/strh pair because nothing between them touches this object. */
