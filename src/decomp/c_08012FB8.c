 * contiguous block at 0x08012FB8.
 * sub_08012FB8 @ 0x08012FB8, sub_08012FE8 @ 0x08012FE8, sub_08013008 @ 0x08013008

/* Creates a gUnknown_08489354 slot, runs a caller-supplied hook on it, then
 * stashes two caller words at +0x20 and +0x24. sub_08012FE8 is the reader of
 * +0x20 and calls it, so the first stashed word is itself a function pointer.
 *
 * `bl _call_via_r5` does NOT mean five arguments. The register-index rule
 * counts arguments only when gcc is free to pick a scratch register; here the
 * pointer arrives as a parameter and must survive the sub_080152EC call, so it
 * is forced into a callee-saved register and the index says nothing.
 *
 * UNPROVED, and byte-neutral either way: whether the hook takes the new slot
 * as an argument. r0 still holds sub_080152EC's result at the `bl` because
 * nothing overwrote it, which is equally consistent with `hook(p)` and with a
 * nullary `hook()`. Spelled with the argument because that is what the value
 * being live there suggests; there is no oracle for it. */

 * `bl _call_via_r0` is a nullary indirect call, and `lsls #0x18; cmp #0` after
