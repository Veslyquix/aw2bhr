 * gSinLut[0] and gSinLut[0x40] -- note gSinLut is DECLARED [0x40] in
 * hardware.h while COS_Q12 indexes 0x40 past it, which is the existing
 * convention here and not something this function introduces.
 *
 * COS_Q12(0) * 16 appears twice (pa and pd) and is CSEd into r8, which is what
 * forces r8 to be pushed; SIN_Q12(0) is likewise read once into r4 and used
 * for both the negated pb and the plain pc.
 *
 * Proc_End does NOT return -- the -1 arm falls straight through into the
 * SetObjAffine call in the ROM too, so there is no `return` after it. */
