/* The erase-sector command sequence for one sector, with interrupts masked

 * shift and +0x18 the sector's size in bytes -- the same two members
 * gUnknown_03005C78 names unk08 and unk04, reached 0x14 higher up the record.
 *
 * The descriptor's ADDRESS is bound to a local because the literal pool word is
 * `gUnknown_084856A4` with addend 0 and the two loads are displacements off it.
 * Pointer arithmetic on the array instead folds the offsets into the address
 * constant -- measured: `*((const u8 *)g + 0x1c)` emits a pool word relocating
 * to g+0x1c and then reaches +0x18 as `subs rN, #4`.
 *
 * The unlock/command writes must be volatile: 0x0E005555 is written twice with
 * different values and agbcc would otherwise drop one. Same idiom as the
 * matched sub_0808B184. The `addr--` after the fill backs the cursor up to the
 * LAST byte written, which is what the poll helper is handed.
 *
 * PARKED at -4 bytes. Every instruction from the REG_IME save onward is
 * byte-exact; the whole residual is that the ROM does NOT coalesce the narrowed
 * parameter with `addr`:
 *
 *     ROM   lsrs r0, r0, #0x10 ; adds r4, r0, #0 ; ldrb r1, [r3, #0x1c] ; lsls r4, r1
 *     ours  lsrs r4, r0, #0x10 ;                   ldrb r0, [r3, #0x1c] ; lsls r4, r0
 *
 * i.e. one `adds r4, r0, #0` short, and the pool then loses its 2-byte
 * alignment pad. See data/parked.json for what was ruled out. */
