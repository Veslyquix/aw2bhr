/* Wave 80 (W80-A): MATCHED by writing the `return TRUE` body FIRST in the
 * switch. The wave-35/39/77 residual was the case-14 leaf's branch polarity
 * (`beq true; b default` vs the ROM's `bne default; b true`). gcc 2.95's
 * expand_end_case emits the decision tree and reorder_insns it to the START of
 * the switch, so the block that follows the tree's last test (the right leaf,
 * {14}) is the FIRST case body in SOURCE order. When that body is the shared
 * `return TRUE`, jump.c inverts the leaf's `beq L; b default; L:` into
 * `bne default; L:` because L is the next block, and cross-jumping then folds
 * the `movs r0,#1; b end` into case 6's identical tail, leaving `bne default;
 * b <tail>` -- the ROM. Case-LABEL order within a group is irrelevant (W39-C
 * measured it); case-BODY order is the lever. See the wave-80 chapter in
 * docs/agbcc-codegen.md. */
