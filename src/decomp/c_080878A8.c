/* Lays out one sub_0804402C sprite per unit past the first, right-to-left from
 * x = 0xd8, then draws two fixed sub_0801F34C sprites.
 *
 * All THREE loop quantities -- the x coordinate, the 0xc-stride tile index and
 * the 0x1000-stride palette field -- are strength-reduction GIVs, not source
 * variables: their inits sit in the preheader AFTER the `bge` entry guard,
 * where only the loop optimiser writes. Authoring them as accumulators puts
 * the inits before the guard and additionally parks the 0x1000 constant in a
 * callee-saved register the ROM rematerialises, which costs 2 bytes. Only
 * `(n - 2) * 0x20` is a source-level invariant, and it is the one thing LICM
 * hoists ahead of those inits.
 *
 * The OR operand order in the third argument decides which giv gets the high
 * register: with the palette term written first, the tile giv lands in r8 and
 * its `+ 0xc` step fits an imm8 `add r8, r0`, which is the ROM's encoding. */
