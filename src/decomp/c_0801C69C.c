 * when the u8 flag is non-zero -- two stores to the same byte, not a ternary
 * (a ternary puts the constant in a register and stores once).
 *
 * `a1->unk18 = 0;` APPEARS TWICE and that is the ROM, not a slip: `strh r5,
 * [r4, #0x18]` is emitted at +0x1c and again at +0x2a with the +0x1e/+0x14/
 * +0x21 stores between them. The two zeroes even come from different pseudos
 * (r5 for the halfwords, r0 for the +0x21 byte). */
