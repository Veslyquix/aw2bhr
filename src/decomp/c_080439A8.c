/* MATCHED (wave 37, W37-Q4), one attempt.
 *
 * The whole signature came off the already-promoted caller sub_080438FC:
 *   sub_080439A8(&va, &vy, &vu, m, lo, 0, vu >= lo, &vt);
 * so a6 is a small selector, a7 a flag and a1/a2/a3/a8 are in-out `int *`.
 * Draws a bar: one PutSprite per pass, *a1 advancing 6 pixels each time,
 * while the remaining amount a5 is positive and stepping down by a4.
 *
 * Three things that are not free choices:
 *
 * - The switch is `case 0: default:` sharing one label, exactly like
 *   sub_08043DAC next door.  The ROM tests `cmp #0; beq default`, then
 *   `cmp #1; beq case1`, and FALLS THROUGH into the default block -- which
 *   only happens when case 0's body IS the default body and is written FIRST.
 *
 * - The `*a3` update is a two-armed if/else with one shared store, not a
 *   ternary: `bge` is the inverted test, so the `<` arm is the fall-through
 *   (movs r0,#0) and the subtract is the else.
 *
 * - `(*a8)--` is a POST-decrement: r0 keeps the old value and the store puts
 *   value-1 back before DivRem is called on the old one.
 *
 * The loop is a plain `while (a5 > 0)`; `bl Div` sits ahead of the `cmp r6,#0;
 * ble` guard, so `half` is a source statement before the loop and not a LICM
 * hoist.  The switch and the a7 test are loop-invariant but stay INSIDE the
 * loop in the ROM, so they are source statements there too.
