/* `id = sub_080206B0(id)` -- the call result is assigned back over the
 * PARAMETER, and that is what produces the otherwise inexplicable
 * `adds r3, r0, #0` before the `bl`. r3 is call-clobbered, so the copy is dead
 * on any reading; agbcc emits it because the parameter's home pseudo is
 * written before being overwritten by the return value. Spelling the result
 * into a fresh local instead drops that instruction and the function comes out
 * 4 bytes short (measured side by side).
 *
 * Everything after the call is the promoted sub_0803CA54 verbatim, with the
 * same `s = &gUnknown_02028030` two-step that keeps `adds r0, #0x12` out of
 * the relocation addend -- and the assignment must sit AFTER the call or the
 * address is held across it in a callee-saved register. */
