/* Draws every army slot whose terrain-cost row says the slot exists.
 *
 * MATCHED wave 73 (W73-F) by decomp-permuter, run THREE TIMES, each run
 * chained from the previous best.c: 91.67% -> 95.11% -> 99.43% -> match.
 * No single run from the 91.67% draft found any of it, and the function had
 * never been permuted at all before this wave -- its parked note concluded
 * "the lever is NOT the local", which was true of the local it had tried and
 * false of the three the permuter found.
 *
 * DO NOT TIDY THIS BODY. Every one of the four locals below is a live-range
 * split and folding any of them back into its expression loses the match:
 *   - new_var3 binds the row pointer used by the GUARD, while the call
 *     argument keeps the whole chain spelled out. The asymmetry is the point:
 *     wave 49 bound BOTH occurrences to one local and lost 8 bytes, because
 *     that collapses the two address chains the ROM recomputes.
 *   - new_var4 binds the argument's copy IN PLACE, inside the argument.
 *   - new_var / new_var2 split the two u8 inputs of the divide's dividend.
 *   - new_var5 is the dividend as a `short`. It is what makes the divide the
 *     ROM's UNSIGNED `lsrs #3` without a (u32) cast: the value is
 *     u8 + u8 * 8, so 0..2295, and gcc's nonzero_bits on the short proves it
 *     non-negative. The old draft reached the same instruction with
 *     `(u32)(a + gUnknown_084C211C[n * 2] * 8) / 8`; both are unsigned shifts
 *     with no round-toward-zero bias, unlike sub_080468D4's signed divide on
 *     the same table.
 *
 * The movement-cost row is the chain c_08038848.c and c_0801F888.c already
 * spell, and it is written out TWICE per iteration on purpose: the ROM
 * recomputes the whole gUnknown_08499598 / gUnknown_085D3DD0 address chain for
 * the guard and again for sub_08014B0C's fourth argument. That is also why the
 * two occurrences materialise the table base differently -- once as the folded
 * pool constant gen_lds.py names gUnknown_085D3E20
 * (= &gUnknown_085D3DD0[0].unk38[0].unk18[0]) and once as gUnknown_085D3DD0
 * plus `adds #0x50` -- and why the same `s8 *` element load comes out
 * `ldrb; lsls #0x18; asrs #0x18` in the guard and `movs rN,#0; ldrsb` in the
 * argument. One source expression, two expansions.
