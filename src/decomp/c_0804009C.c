 * pair. The two NEGATIVE-ONE and NEGATIVE-TWO arms `return`; the -3 arm
 * `break`s and FALLS INTO the shared tail, which is also where every
 * unmatched value lands -- that is why the ROM's -3 body is immediately
 * followed by the tail with no branch, while the other two arms end in
 * `b` to the epilogue. There is no `default:` label: control simply leaves
 * the switch.
 *
 * unk14 is a POINTER, not the `int` its bare `ldr` suggests: it is handed to
 * sub_08013338's third and sub_080130DC's fourth parameters, both declared
 * pointers, and -Werror rejects the integer spelling. */
