/* One command of the gUnknown_03001470[a].unk04 script stream: an EASE, i.e.
 * sub_08016370's smooth move with the acceleration solved for rather than
 * supplied. The four floats behind the command word are a destination offset
 * (x, y), a constant x velocity and a y acceleration; the frame count falls
 * out of the x leg (`(dstX - x) / vx`, made positive), and the y velocity is
 * then chosen so that the ease lands exactly on dstY:
 *     vy = -ay * (n - 1) / 2 + (dstY - y) / n
 * The body of sub_080162A4 is INLINED here rather than called, with one extra
 * step: when the counter retires, the slot is snapped to the exact
 * destination with a second sub_080155C0.
 *
 * `-gPath659C[a].unk58` and NOT `-q[3]`, even though the two are the same
 * value: reading the member back makes agbcc keep the just-stored value in a
 * callee-saved register (`ldr r3,[q,#0xc]; mov r8,r3; str r3,[dst]`, then
 * `mov r0,r8` at the negate), where naming `q[3]` again re-loads it through q
 * and shifts two instructions. Probed both ways, and a `float v = q[3]` local
 * is a third, also-wrong shape -- it hoists the load ABOVE the destination
 * address computation.
 *
 * `n` is s16: __fixsfsi's result is kept as `lsl #16; lsr #16` and re-read
 * `lsl #16; asr #16`, and the negate arm re-truncates. The 0x0808E538 pool
 * word is agbcc's -fforce-addr .rodata address constant holding 0x03001470
 * (dereferenced in baserom.gba), so the honest spelling below reproduces it
 * and promotion must carry the rodata entry; the SECOND reference to the same
 * global, in the inlined sub_080162A4 half, gets an ordinary direct pool word
 * instead, and that too falls out of naming the symbol both times. */
