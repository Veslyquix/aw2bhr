 * discriminating use the field types would otherwise lack -- neither function
 * alone proves unk54 holds a pointer.
 *
 * unk50 is SIGNED: `movs r2, #0; ldrsh r4, [r1, r2]` off a zero index register,
 * where an unsigned field would have been a plain `ldrh` with a displacement.
 * unk52 and unk54 are past the 31-byte `ldrh` displacement limit relative to
 * the anchor agbcc chose, hence the `adds r0, #0x52` chain. */

 * duplication is the if/else, not two different scripts.
 *
 * SIX parameters, and the last two are the reason the widths are settled: they
 * arrive on the stack at [sp,#0x14] and [sp,#0x18] and are read with a plain
 * `ldr` at the point of use. Declared u16, agbcc narrows both in the PROLOGUE
 * instead, which costs an extra callee-saved register and the `mov r7, r8`
 * spill that goes with it. The `strh` at +0x50 and +0x52 is the field's width,
 * not the parameter's -- those are independent facts.
 *
 * The branch sense is `!= 0` with the parent arm inline: agbcc branches on the
 * inverted condition to the ELSE block here, so `beq` reaching the PROC_TREE_3
 * arm makes that arm the else. */
