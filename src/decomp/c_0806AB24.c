/* Lays out a multi-line message box: sub_0807B7BC wraps the string
 * sub_08024944 returned into `proc->unk2f[]`, returning the LINE COUNT and
 * writing the last line's residual width back through its `u16 *`
 * out-parameter. The first line is then centred against the 0xf0 screen width
 * and every later line's start is accumulated from the one before it.
 *
 * `asrs r0, r0, #1` with no round-toward-zero correction is `>> 1` on a signed
 * int, not `/ 2`.
 *
 * `rest` is the FIRST operand of the sum. agbcc expands a PLUS_EXPR's operands
 * left to right, and expanding a MEM emits only its ADDRESS -- so writing
 * `rest + w * (n - 1)` puts `add r2, sp, #4` ahead of the `subs r0, #1` while
 * leaving the `ldrh` after the multiply, which is exactly what the ROM shows.
 * `w * (n - 1)` and not `(n - 1) * w`: the operand copied into the MUL's
 * destination is the left one.
 *
 * `w` has to be a local. The accumulate loop stores through `proc->unk2f`,
 * which may alias the ROM table's own load, so loop.c cannot hoist a
 * `gUnknown_085816B4[n]` written inside the loop -- yet the ROM keeps it in r3
 * across all of it. */
