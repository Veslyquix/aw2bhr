/* MATCHED. The guarded half of the sub_08051BEC / sub_08051F4C install
 * sequence: publish the side and slot, then allocate the sprite ONLY if the
 * slot does not already hold one (`unk24[b] == -1`). It is the function that
 * names gUnknown_085536D4, the animation descriptor whose draw slot is the
 * matched sub_08052154 -- see the descriptor table in
 * include/unknown-globals.h.
 *
 * `f` is `u16` here and `int` in sub_08051BEC / sub_08051F4C, and that is
 * measured, not a style choice: the ROM narrows the `* 7 + 6` product at the
 * ASSIGNMENT (`lsls #0x10; lsrs #0x10` into r7) and again to u8 at the call
 * (`lsls #0x18; lsrs #0x18`). The exemplars have only the second pair, which is
 * what an `int` local gives. Two shift pairs = a narrow local, one = `int`. */
