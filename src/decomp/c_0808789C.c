 * The strongest-evidenced member of the family, because the loop closes: the
 * ROM holds `PROC_CALL(PutEnemyCoMinimug_0808789D)` at 0x08616DA0, which is INSIDE the
 * script ProcScr_PutEnemyCoMinimug -- and sub_08087B74, the callee here, is the
 * function that does `Proc_Find(ProcScr_PutEnemyCoMinimug)` and `str r5,[r0,#0x54]`.
 * So +0x54 of this proc is written by the callee and read back by this
 * wrapper, and it holds sub_08087B74's own `int` parameter (used there as an
 * offset into gUnknown_02027F74 + 4, not as a pointer -- hence `int` and not
 * `void *`). */
