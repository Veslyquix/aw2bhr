/* The setter for the gUnknown_030033F4 bit block that the promoted
 * sub_0803CB74 reads, and it shares that function's two oddities: the index is
 * `id >> 3` with an ARITHMETIC shift (so `int`, not unsigned), and the shift
 * count is the WHOLE id rather than `id & 7`.
 *
 * The address expression belongs inside each arm, not before the `if`: the ROM
 * carries TWO pool words for gUnknown_030033F4 and recomputes `asrs r2, r3, #3`
 * in both branches. Hoisting it to a local computes it once and drops the
 * second pool word (measured). The shared `strb r0, [r2]` tail is gcc's
 * cross-jumping of the two identical stores, not a ternary. */
