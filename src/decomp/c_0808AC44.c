 * The second parameter was declared `int` in unknown-functions.h on the grounds
 * that "nothing types it"; this body does -- `str r0, [r2]` writes
 * &sub_0808AC20 through it, so it is a pointer to a `void (*)(void)`. Retyped
 * there in the same edit; the only caller is unpromoted.
 *
 * gUnknown_03000F70 is re-read with `ldrb` immediately after its own `strb`,
 * which is the `volatile` on its declaration doing its job -- naming the global
 * again rather than reusing `id` is what reproduces it.
 *
 * `cmp r1, #3; bhi` is the unsigned reject, and returning 1 there puts the
 * `movs r0, #1` block after the pool, which is why the success path's
 * `movs r0, #0` needs the `b`. */
