/* One of four whole-list sweeps over the gUnknown_0200E438 slot array. The
 * bound is gUnknown_03003034, the high-water mark sub_0801DC50 maintains; it is
 * re-read every iteration because the call inside the loop can move it, so it
 * must not be hoisted into a local. The `=gUnknown_0808F0A4` in the ROM's
 * literal pool is NOT a global -- it is agbcc's own -fforce-addr address
 * constant for gUnknown_03003034, which is why the read costs two `ldr`s.
