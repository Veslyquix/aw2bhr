 *
 * Both arms return, so the arms are written inverted (c_08017CF0.c rule): the
 * ELSE is emitted inline and the branch goes to the THEN.
 *
 * The trailing `lsls r0, #0x10; asrs r0, #0x10` on sub_08018BAC's result is an
 * INT converted to this function's own `s16` return type, which is what retyped
