/* A proc tick. B (gpKeySt->unk0c & 2) re-opens the view and bumps unk83c; the
 * proc then breaks unless unk836 is set AND unk83c has fallen back to zero,
 * waits out sub_08019260 and the sub_08048EC4 slide, and finally repaints and
 * breaks.
 *
 * `v` is not cosmetic: the ROM passes the sub_08048EC4 result straight back as
 * sub_08012BC8's sixth argument (`str r2, [sp, #4]` reusing the register the
 * `lsr #0x10` left it in), which is also what proves sub_08048EC4 returns a
 * value rather than a flag.
 *
 * gUnknown_0812A15C is a -fforce-addr address word holding &gUnknown_084C30F8,
 * not a global -- the same word as 0x0812A150/154/158. Four references across
 * a merge is what makes agbcc park &gUnknown_084C30F8 in r4 here. */
