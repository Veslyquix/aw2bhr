/* The key-state update: `keys` is the raw pad bitmask (sub_08013510 hands it
 * `~REG_KEYINPUT & 0x3ff`), `st` is gUnknown_03002090. Opposing D-pad pairs
 * cancel first (0x30 = Left|Right, 0xc0 = Up|Down).
 *
 * The parameter is s16 and that is readable: entry is ONE `lsls #0x10` feeding
 * BOTH an `lsrs` (PROMOTE_MODE's zero-extension of the incoming halfword) and
 * an `asrs` (the sign-extension `keys & 0x30` needs to read it as int). A u16
 * parameter has no `asrs` at all.
 *
 * But every use AFTER the two cancels reads the value back out of ->unk08
 * rather than out of `keys`: the ROM's `bics`, both compares and the repeat
 * store all run off the ZERO-extended register, which CSE supplies from the
 * `strh` two instructions earlier. Spelling those uses as `keys` costs an
 * `lsls`/`asrs` pair each, because `keys` is signed and ->unk08 is not -- that
 * is the whole difference between a near-miss and this.
 *
 * The `ldr r0,[r0]` shared by both repeat-reload arms is agbcc merging the
 * common tail of an if/else whose arms differ only in which global they name.
