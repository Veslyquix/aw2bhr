 * stream, same pool words in the same order, verified by diffing the two
 * listings with the local labels stripped. One C body installed from two
 * different animation descriptors (gUnknown_085536EC and gUnknown_08553704),
 * so the two copies need distinct addresses. Read sub_08052650's comment; there
 * is nothing here that is not there, including the `c`/`d` refutation. */
