/* Promoted from assembly; each function below is byte-for-byte
 * identical to the original. Order is address order and must

/* The gUnknown_030032D8 state machine's per-frame tick.
 *
 * `state` is the `-fforce-addr` workaround, not the original source: the ROM's
 * pool word is agbcc's own address-constant for &gUnknown_030032D8, parked at
 * 0x08090D88 because the address is live across the switch's calls. Writing
 * the honest `gUnknown_030032D8` gives byte-identical .text but relocates
 * against this unit's own .rodata, which the .text-only split cannot place.
 * See the gUnknown_08090D88 note in unknown-globals.h. Taking the address into
 * a LOCAL is what keeps -fforce-addr from adding a second .rodata level;
 * dereferencing `gUnknown_08090D88` in place costs one extra `ldr`.
 *
 * `idle` exists for the same reason: the pool load has to be generated after
 * the call so the scheduler can drop it in the slot behind the `bl`.
 *
 * `case 0: break;` is not decoration -- it is what makes the jump table start
 * at 0 and run 21 entries. Without it agbcc bases the table at 1 and adds a
 * `subs r0, #1`. The 19/16/18 order is likewise the source's: GCC lays case
 * bodies out in source order, and the ROM has 19's before 16's.
