 * through the deferred-copy push sub_08011E54, while sub_0803BCA0 and
 * sub_0803BCB8 are a memcpy save/restore pair over two adjacent 0x48-byte
 * IWRAM structs and touch no hardware at all.
 *
 * `movs r2, #0x40` / `#0x48` needs no shift because both fit an imm8; that is
 * the only thing separating this family from F063 and it is a spelling
 * consequence of the constant, not a type one. */
