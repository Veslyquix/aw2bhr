/* A member of the 0x0803Cxxx family only by address -- it is not a bit
 * accessor. It hands out the name string of slot `a`, substituting the ROM
 * fallback gUnknown_0849F320 when the slot is empty (unk13 == 0xff), which is
 * the same emptiness test sub_0803CCB8 makes before copying the name out.
 *
 * The parameter is `u8`: the `lsl #24; lsr #24` at entry is parameter
 * narrowing at the point of use, and an `int` index emits nothing there.
 * `adds r0, r2, #2` puts the member offset on the BASE rather than folding it
 * into the pool word, which is what an aggregate member offset always does --
 * see the pool-fold table in docs/agbcc-codegen.md.
