 * forwarded in r1 without ever being copied. The fourth is the only narrow one
 * (`lsls #0x10; lsrs #0x10`, PROMOTE_MODE) and it is the +0x40 halfword.
 *
 * It RETURNS the proc: the epilogue is `pop {r1}; bx r1` with r0 still holding
 * Proc_Start's result, which a void function would have popped into r0.
 *
 * `p->unk3c = p->unk3e = 0x100` and not two statements -- one `movs`/`lsls`
 * pair feeds two `strh`s and the +0x3e store comes first, i.e. it is the inner
 * assignment. */
