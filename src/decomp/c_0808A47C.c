/* The long member of the family: c_0807F238.c's blend run, then the four BG
 * priority shadows, then the window groups, then four u8 globals and the
 * gDispIo window enables.
 *
 * THE CAST IS REQUIRED HERE and it is the whole difference -- `.raw` compiles
 * to 336 bytes against 328. With `.raw`, cse hoists the `0` belonging to
 * `gUnknown_03002B68 = 0;` -- twenty instructions LATER -- back into the middle
 * of the 0xA00 insert and parks it in a third high register, so the prologue
 * becomes `push {r4,r5,r6}` of high regs where the ROM pushes two. The cast
 * keeps that zero local to its own store. This is the one function of wave 23's
 * six where the two spellings differ, and it differs in the direction OPPOSITE
 * to the wave-21 rule (no zero is live ACROSS the write here). See the wave-23
 * section of docs/agbcc-codegen.md.
 *
 * `gUnknown_030030DC.bits.win0_enable_blend = 1;` is written before the
 * 030030A4 group and its byte-0 store SINKS past it: agbcc merges it with the
 * win0_enable_bg0..obj writes that follow into one read-modify-write, which is
 * the same A4/DC interleave already recorded on these two shadows in
 * include/unknown-globals.h. */
