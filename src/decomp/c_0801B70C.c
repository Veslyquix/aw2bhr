/* An indirect call into the IWRAM overlay copied by sub_0801B6BC. The pool word
 * is the callee's VALUE, not a variable's address: 0x03006029 is odd, there is
 * no load through it, and aw2bhr.map allocates nothing there -- gen_lds.py
 * invented the symbol from the word itself. Same situation as sub_0801B6EC's
 * 0x0300619D, and the `&symbol` cast is what reproduces the relocation the ROM
 * carries; the honest literal emits a bare `.word` instead.
 *
 * `bl _call_via_r3` counts the arguments: r0, r1 and r2 are all occupied, so
 * the call takes three. The two `lsls #0x10; lsrs #0x10` pairs type the second
 * and third as u16; the first rides r0 untouched and nothing types it. */

/* The third entry point into the IWRAM overlay copied by sub_0801B6BC, at
 * 0x03005C89 -- one byte past gUnknown_03005C88, the overlay's own base, with
 * the low bit set for THUMB. That adjacency is the clearest evidence in the
 * block that the region really is code: the copy's destination and this call's
 * target are the same address.
 *
 * `bl _call_via_r4` is FOUR arguments -- r0..r3 are all occupied, so gcc has to
 * reach past the scratch registers for the pointer, which is also why this one
 * pushes r4 where its two neighbours do not. `lsls #0x18; lsrs #0x18` types the
 * first as u8; the other three pass through.
 *
 * It RETURNS the result, and the epilogue is the only thing that says so:
 * `pop {r1}; bx r1` preserves r0 across the return where the void form would
 * have popped into r0 and clobbered it. Both are 24 bytes, so size does not
 * discriminate -- the register does. No re-narrowing, so `int`. */
