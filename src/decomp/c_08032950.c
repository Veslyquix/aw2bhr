/* sub_0803227C's wrap-around twin: same left/right slot stepper, but the index
 * wraps with `& 3` instead of an explicit bounds pair, it records the direction
 * in unk10, and a changed slot restarts the gUnknown_0849B688 proc.
 *
 * Two read-outs earned this one:
 *
 * - The guard is `Proc_Exists(...) == TRUE`, NOT `Proc_Find(...) != NULL`. The
 *   `== TRUE` forces the macro's `?:` through do_store_flag as a VALUE, giving
 *   the branchless `rsbs r1,r0,#0; orrs r1,r0` whose sign combine then tests
 *   with `cmp #0; blt`. Every direct spelling (`!= 0`, `== 0`, `!`, and bare
 *   `Proc_Exists(...)`) folds to a plain `cmp r0,#0; bne` and is 4 bytes short
 *   -- measured, all five in one probe.
 *
 * - `i` is u16, not s16. `ldrh` fills it and `(i +/- 1) & 3` is provably 0..3,
 *   so nothing re-extends it; s16 costs `lsls #0x10; asrs #0x10` on every step.
 *
 * The final test compares the two MEMBERS (`unk06 != unk04`), not member
 * against `i` -- that is why both sides get `lsls #0x10` where sub_0803227C,
 * comparing against its own local, shifts only one. */

/* The local `u8 *v[3]` initialiser makes agbcc emit FOUR .rodata objects: the
 * three one-character string literals and then the 12-byte template it block-
 * copies to the stack (`ldm r0!,{r2,r3,r4}; stm r1!,{r2,r3,r4}`). The layout is
 * strings-first, so the template lands at .rodata + 0xc -- exactly the ROM's
 * layout: the literals are at 0x08090D3C/40/44 (words 0x31, 0x32, 0x33, i.e.
 * "1", "2", "3") and the template at 0x08090D48.
 *
 * PROMOTION NEEDS the whole six-word run, starting at 0x08090D3C and not at
 * the 0x08090D48 the .text pool word names:
 *     "rodata": ["0x08090D3C", "0x08090D40", "0x08090D44",
 *                "0x08090D48", "0x08090D4C", "0x08090D50"]
 *
 * The stack block-copy is what proves the array is a NON-STATIC LOCAL with an
 * initialiser: a file-scope `static const char *const[]` would be indexed in
 * place, with no template and no `sub sp` for it.
 *
 * This function sat at 99.6% across several waves for a HARNESS reason, not a
 * decompilation one: the template's three words relocate against the local
 * `.rodata` section symbol (they point at the literals beside them), and
 * trymatch.py's pool_word_equivalent() resolved every relocation through
 * sym_addr(), which cannot name a section. It now anchors a `.rodata`
 * self-reference on the section base it has already computed. The C below is
 * unchanged from the draft that was reported as a near-miss.
