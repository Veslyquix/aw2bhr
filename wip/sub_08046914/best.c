 *
 * gUnknown_08610A38 IS a real table, not an agbcc -fforce-addr pool word: it is
 * indexed by a computed subscript (`lsls #2; adds`) BEFORE anything is
 * dereferenced. The words at 0x0812A110 and 0x0812A114 are the opposite case --
 * they hold 0x08499578 and 0x084C20C0, i.e. they are private address constants
 * for gUnknown_08499578 and gUnknown_084C20C0 -- so both are spelled honestly
 * here and neither is declared.
 *
 * `lsrs r0,#0x1f; adds; asrs #1` after sub_08014CEC is a SIGNED divide by two,
 * not a shift, and the result is centred with `w / 2 - 0x50`. The `lsls #0xd;
 * asrs #0x10` that follows is a `/ 8` fused with an (s16) cast, where the
 * unbiased `(a + 0x38) / 8` further down is unsigned because a is u8.
 *
 * `t` has to be a u32 local: the ROM spills `a + 0x38` and reloads it before
 * the second divide, and across the spill combine has lost the range fact that
 * makes the divide unsigned. The two `(a + 0x50) / 8` uses are recomputed from
 * the parameter, so they keep it. */
