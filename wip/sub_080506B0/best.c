/* PARKED at 36.2%, candidate is 692 bytes against 680 (+12). Wave 37, W37-J.
 *
 * The instruction ORDER matches the ROM from the prologue to the `bx`; every
 * remaining difference is register allocation plus which address constants
 * agbcc parked in its `-fforce-addr` .rodata pool. Concretely:
 *
 *   +2  (*sidep) comes out as `ldr rA,=.LC; ldr rB,[rA]` where the ROM
 *       has a plain inline pool word.
 *   +2  (*slotp), same.
 *   -2  gUnknown_03004580 comes out as a plain pool word where the ROM has the
 *       .rodata form (its word is gUnknown_081360D4).
 *   +2  the `~0x0c` objMode mask is hoisted into sl and reused at the second
 *       objMode write; the ROM rematerialises `movs r0,#0xd; rsbs r0,r0,#0`.
 *   -2  the ROM copies the 0x3FF mask (`adds r0,r2,#0`) before the `ands`.
 *   -2  the ROM copies v (`adds r0,r1,#0`) before `cmp r0,#0x17`.
 *   The tail then differs only in which of &gUnknown_02029A10 /
 *   &gUnknown_08553C18 / &gUnknown_085D6A48 live in callee-saved registers
 *   versus being reloaded from the pool at each statement.
 * Every one of those is the SAME symptom read from both ends: this candidate
 * carries FEWER simultaneously-live values than the original, so agbcc has
 * spare callee-saved registers and spends them on constants and addresses the
 * ROM rematerialises. The missing live value has not been identified.
 * Wave 63: binding the tileNum source to a u16 local does not produce the
 * missing mask copy or supply the missing live value; configured remains
 * 692/680 (+12), 434/680 bytes differ (36.2%).
 *
 * Axes RULED OUT (each measured, do not re-spend them):
 *   - dx/dy MUST be `s16`. A controlled probe (four spellings of the
 *     conditional negate) shows only a promoted `s16` local gives the ROM's
 *     `lsls #0x10; rsbs #0; lsrs #0x10`; `u16` and `int` both give
 *     `neg; lsl; lsr`, in that order, which is a different instruction stream.
 *   - The gUnknown_085D6A48 COLUMN reads must go through a struct-row cast, not
 *     `gUnknown_085D6A48[i][j]` on the declared `u16 [][12]`. The ROM keeps the
 *     column offset in the load displacement (`adds r0,r0,r2; ldrh r0,[r0,#2]`
 *     and `ldrh r1,[r0,#0x14]`); the flat subscript reassociates the offset onto
 *     the symbol and pays an extra `adds` per read. Same finding the wave-17
 *     note on that global predicted, now confirmed at three columns.
 *   - The COMMA ANCHOR on `tbl` is required: without it the subscript is
 *     evaluated first and gUnknown_03004580's address is materialised ahead of
 *     gUnknown_085D6A48's, which is the wrong pool order. Same lever as
 *     src/decomp/c_080505A4.c.
 *   - Operand order inside the two big sums is `entries[j].x + <08553C18 term>
 *     + dx`: the ROM computes the gUnknown_02029A10 element pointer SECOND
 *     (right after the destination address) and loads the 08553C18 halfword
 *     FIRST, which is the "address computed first is loaded second" reversal.
 *     Writing the 08553C18 term first moves its whole chain ahead of the entry
 *     pointer.
 *   - gUnknown_0202972C and gUnknown_02029710[..].unk3a are BOTH real: the ROM
 *     holds `=gUnknown_0202972C` for the first store and `=gUnknown_02029710`
 *     plus `adds #0x3a` for the second, in one function.
 *   - The 0x08136 pool words were dumped out of baserom.gba: 081360CC ->
 *     02029710, 081360D0 -> 085D6A48, 081360D4 -> 03004580. All three are
 *     `-fforce-addr` .rodata address constants, not globals.

/* WAVE 77 (W77-A): re-measured, +12 bytes / 36.2% (the brief quoted +2; the

 * `-fforce-addr` .rodata word for it anywhere, so the array spelling in the

 * The ROM instead spends its extra register on the CONSTANT 0xb4
 * (`movs r1,#0xb4; mov r8,r1; mov r0,r8; muls r0,r4,r0`), which is the same
 * "one more live value, and it is a constant" symptom the note above records.
 * Residual kind 3 (allocation).  No new axis; not re-spent.

/* WAVE 77 (W77-H).  Re-verified +12 bytes / 36.2%, first difference at +0xc.
 * Draft unchanged.  The +12 is a force-addr WORD COUNT, and here is the whole of
 * it:
 *   ROM pool:       plain gUnknown_0300453C, plain gUnknown_0300451C, THREE
 *                   force-addr words (gUnknown_081360CC/D0/D4), and NO plain
 *                   gUnknown_03004580 word at all.
 *   candidate pool: FOUR force-addr words, plus plain gUnknown_0300453C, plain
 *                   gUnknown_0300451C AND plain gUnknown_03004580.
 * So this candidate force-addrs two symbols the ROM keeps plain and fails to
 * force-addr the one symbol the ROM does.  The rest of the diff follows: the two
 * surplus `ldr rN,[rM,#0]` indirections at the unk30/unk34 stores, the
 * `mov sl, r2 / mov r0, sl` needed to park the -13 constant, and the ROM's
 * uncoalesced `adds r0, r1, #0` ahead of `cmp r0, #23`.
 *
 * MEASURED AND RULED OUT this wave: giving gUnknown_03004580 a SECOND by-name
 * read (re-reading `gUnknown_03004580[side][1]` in the `v == 0x17` test instead
 * of caching it at the subscript) is BYTE-IDENTICAL -- same size, same 36.2%,
 * same first difference.  Nothing stores to memory between the two reads so CSE
 * collapses them; per wave 37 W37-K3 the count force-addr settles on is the one
 * that SURVIVES CSE, and you cannot add a surviving reference by writing one.
 *
 * The W77-A note above is confirmed: this function's gUnknown_02029A10 word is a
 * PLAIN literal in the ROM, so it must keep the array spelling.  Residual
 * kind 3. */
