# sub_08020754 -- wave 91 (W91-A)

Draft unchanged: 220 of 208 bytes (+12), 27.9%, first difference +0xc.

## The pre-registered member-form test: NEGATIVE (byte-identical)

This draft was ALREADY a member form -- through its own local
`struct Unk20754Map` (width/height/unit at 0x51A/cell at 0x1432/rowOffset), not
raw byte offsets. Respelled through the shared `struct Map`
(`((struct Map *)gUnknown_08499590)->terrain[...]`, `->unitUnk[...]`,
`->rowOffset[y]`) and again through `gMap`: both compile to a `_cand.bin`
`cmp`-identical to the wave-90 draft. Nothing to gain on this axis.

## What the -da dumps say the residual is (new this wave)

`python tools/rtldump.py sub_08020754 --flags="-da -dp"` on the struct-Map
spelling. In `dump.cse`, the `= 0` arm (code_label 234) already uses reg 47
(the loop-top `rowOffset[y] + x`), and the `= 1` arm (code_label 260)
recomputes from a fresh load of gUnknown_08499590. The `= 0` arm is NOT the
fall-through of anything CSE can walk through -- it starts with a label -- so
CSE reached it by `-fcse-skip-blocks`: the `unit == 0` jump branches AROUND the
unit-type block (which has no other entry) to a single-use label, and
cse_end_of_basic_block follows such a jump (`AROUND`), invalidating only what
the skipped block sets. The `= 1` label has two uses (the 0x13 test and the
range test), so no path can follow into it.

The ROM is the mirror image: `= 1` reuses r2, `= 0` recomputes with a reload
of the global. So the ROM's source must, at CSE time, (a) deny the skip-blocks
path into the `= 0` arm (its label had a second use, or the type-check block
had a second entry) AND (b) give the `= 1` label one use preceded by a barrier.
The park's older text ("CSE stays on the fall-through, so the `= 0` arm keeps
the value") names the wrong mechanism: it is skip_blocks, not fall-through.

## Measured this wave (all against the struct-Map draft)

- k1: negated tests each `goto one;`, then `= 0; continue; one: = 1;` --
  byte-identical to the draft (27.9%, +12).
- k2: nested `if (terrain test) { if (unit == 0) goto zero; if (type test)
  { zero: = 0; continue; } } = 1;` -- byte-identical.
- k4: `... && !(unit != 0 && (u8)(type - 0x10) <= 4)` -- byte-identical.
- k3: `if (cond) goto zero; = 1; continue; zero: = 0;` -- +8, 45.7%, but it
  puts the `= 1` arm first, recomputes there, and grows the frame to
  `sub sp,#8`. Wrong direction.
