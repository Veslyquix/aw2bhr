# sub_08055940

0x08055940, 248 bytes, THUMB, parked.

Best score so far: 96.4%.

## What it does

Counts the used slots (entries that are not 0xff) in each side's five-entry row of gUnknown_020296BC. It zeroes a side's count in some cases (depending on a1 or a2 being 2 and on gUnknown_0300450C, or when that side's gUnknown_03004580 column 1 is 9 or 0x14), then calls sub_08055A38(count0, 1) and sub_08055A38(count1, 0).

## How close it is

Compiles to the right size (248 bytes); 9 of 248 bytes differ (96.4% identical), all in five instructions that set up the counting loop. The rest of the function matches.

## What is left

The original loads the address of row 1 (gUnknown_020296E4) and derives row 0 by subtracting 40, with the loop's four set-up values in a particular order; the draft loads row 0 and adds 40. Writing `row1 = gUnknown_020296E4[0]; row0 = row1 - 20;` as two statements gives the right load and subtraction but puts other set-up code in the wrong place. What remains is a loop body whose first loop-invariant value is the address of counts[0] and whose last is row 0 derived from row 1, so that the compiler moves them out of the loop in the original's order.

## Already tried

- Indexing from row 1 with a negative offset (`gUnknown_020296E4[i - 20]`, `[-1][i]`, pointer arithmetic): an extra subtract inside the loop, or the -40 is folded into the pool word.
- Row pointer locals set before the loop: the right subtraction, but 12 bytes lost in the loop body (13.7% identical).
- A row pointer or an offset variable declared inside the loop: identical to the draft, or the offset is recomputed on every pass.
- Swapping the two blocks of the loop body: 14 bytes differ (94.4%).
- Hand-inverting the loop and writing the four set-up values as statements in the original's order: right pool word and order, but the values land in the wrong registers (92.7%).
- Permuter runs, undirected and aimed at the row spellings and block orders (about 40,000 tries): nothing better; its own score does not track the real one here.

### Notes

PARKED Wave 70 at exact size 248/248 with 9 differing bytes. ROM anchors row 1 at gUnknown_020296E4 then derives row 0 with subs #0x28; every candidate anchors row 0 or moves the subtraction into the varying address. Biased declarations, flat/2D subscripts, function/block pointer scopes, self-assignments and zero-trip wrappers are ruled out. Wave 70's row-1 cursor selected the upper anchor but dropped 12 bytes elsewhere. Preserve the active draft. Wave 77, W77-L: configured re-verdict still 248/248 with NINE differing bytes, all five halfwords in one run at +0x28..+0x30. ROM: `mov r3,sp | ldr r5,=gUnknown_020296E4 | adds r4,r7,#0 | adds r6,r5,#0 | subs r6,#0x28`. Candidate: `ldr r6,=gUnknown_020296BC | mov r3,sp | adds r5,r6,#0 | adds r5,#0x28 | adds r4,r7,#0`. So it is the anchor direction AND the interleaving of the invariant hoists, one fact. NEWLY RULED OUT: binding row1/row0 pointer locals while leaving the counts[] spelling completely untouched -- both `row1 = gUnknown_020296BC[1]; row0 = row1 - 20;` and `row0 = gUnknown_020296BC[0];` come out at -12 bytes / 13.7%, identical to each other and to Wave 70's cursor. That isolates the collateral: it is NOT the counts cursor (which stays byte-exact at +0x18..+0x26 in the active draft), it is that ANY pointer local for a row inhibits the ROM's GIV and costs 12 bytes in the loop body. The row spelling and the anchor direction cannot be separated, so the next lever must reach the anchor WITHOUT introducing a pointer local. Wave 80 (W80-D): every row-1-named spelling is now measured and none reaches it. `gUnknown_020296E4[i - 20]` puts `subs #0x14` in the loop body (fold does not distribute the -20 over the *2). `(&gUnknown_020296E4)[-1][i]`, `*(gUnknown_020296E4 - 20 + i)` and `*(u16 *)((u8 *)gUnknown_020296E4 - 0x28 + i * 2)` all fold to ONE pool word `gUnknown_020296E4-0x28` and derive row 1 with `adds #0x28`: byte-identical to the draft except the reloc name. An IN-LOOP pointer local (`u16 *row0 = gUnknown_020296E4 - 20;` declared in the body) and an in-loop `int base` are ALSO byte-identical to the draft, so the -12 bytes recorded in wave 77 came from locals defined OUTSIDE the loop, not from pointer locals as such. Naming both symbols (`gUnknown_020296BC[0][i]` and `(&gUnknown_020296E4)[0][i]`) gives two pool words. Mechanism pinned: the two row reads sit in different extended basic blocks of the loop body, so cse1 cannot relate them; LICM hoists the four invariants in BODY order, and cse2 then derives whichever row constant sits SECOND in the preheader from the first. Every row-0-first body therefore yields [row0][&counts0][row1][&counts1] and the +0x28 direction. The ROM's [&counts0][E4][&counts1][E4-0x28] needs the row-0 constant hoisted AFTER &counts[1] -- a deferred hoist (second loop pass or a below-threshold movable) that no body spelling tried produces. Bare hoist-order tie; stopped at the wave-80 two-attempt rule. W82-A: swapping the two loop-body BLOCKS (do-while row-1 block first, then the counts[0] if) is semantically free and gives 14 differ / 94.4%, first difference still +0x28 -- body statement order reaches the hoist order but this direction loses; deferred-hoist shapes remain unreached. WAVE 83 (W83-B): include/unknown-globals.h now declares gUnknown_020296E4[][20] (map: linker alias `= .` over *fill*; evidence in the comment there). Two compile_probes (no try_match spent) of the deferred-hoist shape with an OPAQUE offset local both FAIL: `neg = -20; gUnknown_020296E4[0][neg + i]` and the gUnknown_020296BC[1][neg + i] twin produce IDENTICAL bodies with the pool word staying pure (.word gUnknown_020296E4 vs .word gUnknown_020296BC+0x28 -- the decl choice alone relocates cleanly), but fold/strength_reduce keep `(neg + i) * 2` WHOLE IN THE BODY (`add neg,i; lsl #1`) off ONE base register, so neither the ROM's two preheader-derived row bases nor `subs r6,#0x28` ever materialise; allocation elsewhere reshuffles (i lands in callee-saved). tools/permute.py --current 240s/4 threads: NO candidate above the starting point (first permuter run ever recorded here). Deferred-hoist via opaque offset joins the ruled-out list; the open form remains a spelling whose -0x28 folds into a RUNTIME subs on a derived base while the pool word stays pure.

WAVE87: WAVE 87 (W87-E, preheader-order lever from W87-C's sub_08028D28 match): the lever REACHES what six waves (63/70/77/80/82/83) called unreachable -- variant a (work/sub_08055940/w87-variantA.c: hand-inverted loop, four preheader invariants bound as SOURCE statements inside the zero-trip `if` in the ROM's order `c0 = &counts[0]; row1 = gUnknown_020296E4[0]; c1 = &counts[1]; row0 = row1 - 20;`) is the FIRST spelling to produce the ROM's pure gUnknown_020296E4 pool word with the row-0 base derived at RUNTIME (`add r6,r5,#0 / sub r6,r6,#0x28`) AND the ROM's four-value preheader order [&counts0][E4][&counts1][E4-0x28]. Load-bearing: the TWO-STATEMENT split `row1 = E4[0]; row0 = row1 - 20;` -- as ONE statement (variants c/d, before the for or inside the if) the -0x28 folds into the pool word (the parked draft's shape); position does not defeat the fold, the split does. Variant b (binds before a `for`) puts `i = 0` after the binds (ROM has `movs r2,#0` first). Variant e (row0 left as `(row1 - 20)[i]` in the body) leaks the -0x28 into the loop body per iteration (confirms wave 82 for the bound-pseudo form). REFUTED as the ROM's mechanism: variant a's binds land on the wrong side (c0/c1 in r4/r3 where the ROM has r3/r4) and the body's invariants are then all source, not hoists; the ROM's preheader is LICM movables in the order [&counts0][E4][&counts1][E4-0x28], i.e. the current body order [row0][c0][row1][c1] rotated LEFT BY ONE. Active draft RESTORED to the 96.4% parked version (9/248 re-verified); do NOT re-rule-out the E4 anchor, it is reached. Next, a BODY question: a body whose first invariant reference is counts[0]'s address and whose last movable is the row-0 subtraction off the already-hoisted E4 pseudo.

WAVE90: WAVE 90 (W90-A): unchanged 96.4%/9 bytes. Permuter undirected 11,463 it and DIRECTED (PERM_GENERAL over gUnknown_020296BC[0][i]/gUnknown_020296E4[-1][i] and gUnknown_020296BC[1][i]/gUnknown_020296E4[0][i] x four block orders, inside RANDOMIZE) 11,636 it: permuter score 680 -> 420 but EVERY improved candidate is WORSE by bytes (89.1-95.6%), so the corrected objective does not track the verdict on this preheader-order residual. .loop dump: all five preheader values are pass-1 LICM hoists in body order; pass 2 moves nothing. W87-E variant A re-measured 92.7% (order right; c0/c1 r4/r3 and the post-loop &counts[1] copy + gUnknown_08136158 hoist land after the binds). Run 3 undirected from W87-E variant A (92.7%, the order-right base) 15,557 it: best 95.97% by bytes (it moves `row0 = row1 - 20` into the loop body, a legal rewrite that LICM hoists back; kept as work/sub_08055940/w90-varA-perm3-9597.c), still below the 96.4% draft, which was restored from w90-start.c and re-verified 96.37%.
