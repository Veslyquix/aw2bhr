# sub_08055940 — 248 bytes, 93.5% by hand / 96.4% after the permuter, NOT matched

Wave 51, W51-H. `trymatch` exit code 1. **Size is exact (248/248) and the
instruction MULTISET is exact.** Every differing byte is a register field or the
order of four preheader instructions. Nothing about the semantics is open.

## What the function is

```c
void sub_08055940(u16 a1, u16 a2)
{
    u16 counts[2];
    u16 i;

    counts[0] = 0;
    counts[1] = 0;

    for (i = 0; i < 5; i++)
    {
        if (gUnknown_020296BC[0][i] != 0xff) counts[0]++;
        if (gUnknown_020296BC[1][i] != 0xff) counts[1]++;
    }

    if (a1 == 2 && gUnknown_0300450C == 0) counts[1] = 0;
    if (a2 == 2 && gUnknown_0300450C == 1) counts[0] = 0;
    if (a1 == 2 && gUnknown_0300450C != 0) counts[0] = 0;
    if (a2 == 2 && gUnknown_0300450C != 1) counts[1] = 0;

    if (gUnknown_03004580[0][1] == 9 || gUnknown_03004580[0][1] == 0x14) counts[0] = 0;
    if (gUnknown_03004580[1][1] == 9 || gUnknown_03004580[1][1] == 0x14) counts[1] = 0;

    sub_08055A38(counts[0], 1);
    sub_08055A38(counts[1], 0);
}
```

That is `work/sub_08055940/sub_08055940.c` as it stands. Everything in it is
confirmed against the ROM instruction for instruction: the four `== 2` guards,
their **bound and sense** (guards 3 and 4 are `!= 0` / `!= 1`, not `== 1` /
`== 0` — the twin sub_08055654 spells the same four the other way and it is a
real source difference, not a normalisation artefact), the two `9 || 0x14`
tests, the argument order of `sub_08055A38(count, side)`, and the fact that
`side` is 1 for `counts[0]` and 0 for `counts[1]`.

`gUnknown_08136158` is **not a global** — it is a `-fforce-addr` `.rodata` pool
word holding 0x03004580. The honest spelling (`gUnknown_03004580[0][1]` /
`[1][1]`) reproduces it exactly; `trymatch` prints `R_ARM_ABS32 .rodata` against
the ROM's `gUnknown_08136158` and that half is correct and needs no work.

## The entire residual, and it is ONE fact

The ROM's literal pool holds the **bare symbol `gUnknown_020296E4`** (addend 0)
and derives the lower row with a register subtract:

```
    ldr  r5, =gUnknown_020296E4     @ 0x020296E4
    adds r6, r5, #0
    subs r6, #0x28                  @ 0x020296BC
```

Every spelling tried puts the **bare symbol at the LOWER address** in the pool
and derives the upper row by adding:

```
    ldr  r5, =gUnknown_020296BC
    adds r7, r5, #0
    adds r7, #0x28
```

Same instruction count, opposite direction, and the r6/r7 roles swap out of it —
which is the whole 16-byte diff. The two rows are 0x28 = 40 bytes apart and both
addresses have their own `aw2bhr.lds` symbol, but the ROM's SINGLE pool word plus
the subtract proves they are **one object**, not two neighbouring globals: two
distinct symbols cannot be CSEd into each other. That is what
`extern u16 gUnknown_020296BC[][20];` in `include/unknown-globals.h` records.

## Axes ruled out, with what each produced

- **`gUnknown_020296BC[0][i]` / `[1][i]` (the shape above)** — 93.5%. Pool holds
  the bare lower symbol, `adds #0x28`.
- **Flat array, `gUnknown_020296E4[i - 20]` / `[i]`** — much worse. gcc
  reassociates the −20 into the *index*: `add r0,r1,#0; sub r0,#0x14; lsl r0,#1;
  add r0,r0,r4`, four instructions inside the loop instead of a hoisted base.
- **2-D negative row, `gUnknown_020296E4[-1][i]` / `[0][i]`** — the pool word
  becomes the bare `gUnknown_020296E4`, **which is the right symbol**, but gcc
  again folds the −0x28 into the varying part (`lsl r1,r2,#1; add r0,r1,#0;
  sub r0,#0x28; add r0,r0,r5`) instead of hoisting `sym - 0x28` as its own
  invariant. So the negative row index gets you the right pool word and the
  wrong association.
- **Two pointer locals assigned before the loop** (`pB = gUnknown_020296BC[1];
  pA = gUnknown_020296BC[0];`) — this is the closest near-miss and worth
  re-reading. It produces `.word gUnknown_020296BC+0x28` (the RIGHT address,
  reloc naming a different symbol that resolves to it, which is the accepted
  false-mismatch class) **and** `sub r7, r7, #0x28` — the ROM's arithmetic,
  exactly. It fails only on PLACEMENT: the two `ldr`s land before the `for`-init
  because they are pre-loop source statements, whereas the ROM's whole preheader
  is LICM output sitting *after* `movs r2, #0`. Instruction multiset identical,
  order wrong.
- **decomp-permuter, 300 s / 4 threads** — reached 96.4% (kept in `best.c`,
  header-expanded) but no match. It moves registers, not the CSE
  canonicalisation, so it cannot reach this.

## What the next agent should try

The ROM's preheader order is `[&counts[1] copy, .rodata pool addr, &counts[0],
gUnknown_020296E4, &counts[1] copy 2, gUnknown_020296E4 - 0x28]`. The row-0 base
is emitted **last** because it *depends* on the row-1 base — that dependency is
the tell, and it is only produced when CSE canonicalises on the UPPER address.
So the source must name the object at 0x020296E4 and reach 0x020296BC as a
subtract, while keeping both inside the loop body so LICM does the hoisting.
The pointer-local experiment shows the arithmetic is reachable; what is missing
is a spelling that keeps it inside the loop. Try binding the row-1 base to a
`u16 *` **whose initialiser is itself loop-invariant but written inside the loop
body**, or a `u16 (*)[20]` cursor.

Nothing here is a type, layout or control-flow question. Do not re-derive the
body.

## Wave 58, W58-D — the arithmetic is now REACHABLE; only the ORDER is left

The "what the next agent should try" above was right and it works. Binding the
row-1 base to a `u16 *` **inside the loop body**, row 1 FIRST, gets the ROM's
canonicalisation:

```c
    for (i = 0; i < 5; i++)
    {
        u16 *p1 = gUnknown_020296BC[1];
        u16 *p0 = gUnknown_020296BC[0];

        if (p0[i] != 0xff)
            counts[0]++;
        if (p1[i] != 0xff)
            counts[1]++;
    }
```

93.1%, size exact, and the pool word is now `gUnknown_020296BC + 0x28` (the
ROM's `gUnknown_020296E4`, the accepted same-address reloc class) with
`subs r7, #40` — **the ROM's direction, with the bases still hoisted by LICM
rather than by a pre-loop statement.** Which symbol wins the pool word is
decided purely by which is referenced FIRST in the loop body; nothing else moves
it.

**What is left is four instructions of preheader ORDER, and only that:**

```
ROM        movs r2,#0 | adds r7,r0,#0 | ldr/mov sb | mov r3,sp | ldr r5,=E4 | adds r4,r7,#0 | adds r6,r5,#0 ; subs r6,#0x28
candidate  movs r2,#0 | adds r6,r0,#0 | ldr/mov sb | ldr r5,=E4 | adds r7,r5,#0 ; subs r7,#40 | mov r3,sp | adds r4,r6,#0
```

The ROM's order is `[&counts[0], E4, &counts[1], BC]` — i.e. **BC is hoisted
LAST, after the two count addresses**, which is `move_movables` deferring it to
a second pass because it depends on E4's pseudo. The candidate hoists both bases
first, in body order, because both are defined in the first statement of the
body. Reproducing the ROM needs BC's move insn to sit at the FIRST `if` while
naming a pseudo defined at the SECOND, which no C statement order produces.

Also measured this wave, both null:

- **The permuter's `do { } while (0)` around the second `if` is NOT additive.**
  It is what got `best.c` to 96.4% on the ORIGINAL body, but applied on top of
  the pointer-bound body above it is byte-identical to it (17 of 248, same
  diff). Do not stack the two.
**THE SHIPPED DRAFT IS NOW THE 96.4% BODY** — the plain statements with a
`do { } while (0)` around the SECOND `if`, in clean C. That is the permuter's
wave-51 find reproduced by hand; it had only ever existed as header-expanded
`best.c`, which is not a usable draft. 9 of 248 bytes differ and **the whole
rest of the function is byte-exact** — the r6/r7 role swap that used to run
through the tail is gone, and both bases now sit in the ROM's own registers
(r6 = the row-0 base used first, r5 = row 1):

```
ROM        mov r3,sp | ldr r5,=E4      | adds r4,r7,#0 | adds r6,r5,#0 ; subs r6,#40
candidate  ldr r6,=BC | mov r3,sp      | adds r5,r6,#0 ; adds r5,#40   | adds r4,r7,#0
```

So the residual is now ONLY the pool direction plus where the `ldr` sits.

- The pointer-bound body (93.1%) and the `do { } while (0)` body (96.4%) each
  fix ONE half and **cannot be combined** — stacking them measures 93.1%,
  because the in-body pointer declarations are what move the hoists ahead of
  `mov r3,sp`. Getting the E4-first reference without a pre-bound pointer is
  the whole remaining question.
- Score note: the pointer-bound body reads LOWER than the plain one while being
  strictly closer in mechanism (right symbol, right subtract). Positional score,
  again; paste the block above back in if you work this.

**Classification: basic-block / instruction ORDER across a loop boundary** —
the same unreachable family as `sub_080373F0`'s block layout and W58-A's LICM
hoist. Instruction multiset is exact.
