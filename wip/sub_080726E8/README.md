## What has been tried

From `data/parked.json`.

### Best so far

228 bytes against 216 (+12), 18.5% identical, first difference at +0xa. Re-verified wave 73 (W73-C). THE DRAFT SCORES 18.5%; the 56.9% trymatch prints as 'best so far' is best.c's score and is NOT the draft -- best.c is 142KB of permuter output and is not a readable draft.

### What still differs

ONE FACT: agbcc strength-reduces both pointers in the FLIPPED arm -- `subs r2,#2` walking the source backwards and `adds r3,#2` walking the destination forwards, plus two extra frame slots for their hoisted initial values, which is where the +12 bytes and the spill of `x` out of r7 come from -- where the ROM recomputes BOTH addresses from scratch every iteration and reduces nothing. The ROM's flipped inner loop hoists only `lsls r3,r5,#6` (iy*64) and the 0x400 constant, and its only induction variable is `ix` itself.

### Why it is close

Everything else is byte-exact and must be kept: the UNFLIPPED arm (which the ROM DOES reduce, and which this reproduces instruction for instruction), the prologue, the frame holding map at [sp] and p at [sp,#4], both clip tests, and the register map (ip = w, sl = y, base in sb).

### Already ruled out

- THE ROM'S OWN TWO ARMS ARE THE PROOF THAT SPELLING IS NOT THE VARIABLE: they index the same map with the same clip tests and differ only in whether the compiler reduced. Do not spend attempts on index spellings.
- Source index spelling: `src[iy*0x20 + (w-ix-1)]`, `*(src + (w-ix-1) + iy*0x20)`, `src[iy*0x20 + w - ix - 1]` and `*(p + (w - (ix+1)))` all strength-reduce identically.
- Destination spelling: `map[(y+iy)*0x20 + (x+ix)]` folds the index and scales it once (`lsl #5; add; lsl #1`) and is wrong for BOTH arms; `*(map + (x+ix) + (y+iy)*0x20)` gives the ROM's two separate scalings (`lsls #6` for the row, `lsls #1` for the column). This one WAS worth bytes and is kept.
- `p` as a separate local seeded from `src` versus reassigning the `src` parameter. The local is right: it puts p's ldr/str after the promoted-mode conversion group, exactly where the ROM has it, and the same change closed the siblings sub_080727C0 and sub_0807286C.
- `u8 flip` versus `int flip`. The lone `lsls r0,r0,#0x18` in the conversion group is the u8 parameter's PROMOTE_MODE extension with the `lsr` dropped by combine, so u8 is right.
- Two separate loop nests versus one nest with the flip test inside. The ROM has two nests (the `beq` is above both).
- Wave 57 (W57-D): `w - (ix + 1)` spelled explicitly in place of `w - ix - 1`. Still reduces both pointers AND additionally spills `x` out of r7 into [sp,#0xc], so strictly worse. Note what this means for READING the ROM: its `adds r4,r2,#1` at the top of the flipped inner body, shared between the source index and the loop increment, is a CONSEQUENCE of the giv not being reduced, not a cause of it. Do not try to reproduce that sharing from the source.
- Wave 72 (W72-F): CROSS-ARM POINTER LIVENESS. Keeping the original src parameter live for the unflipped arm is byte-neutral -- the flipped arm still reduces both pointer GIVs and keeps the 16-byte frame. Distinct q/out locals used only by the later arm increase the frame to 20 bytes WITHOUT suppressing either giv.
- decomp-permuter: 300 s, 4 threads, no byte match.

### Settled

- The function blits a w-by-h block of tilemap entries into a 32-wide BG tilemap at (x,y), adding `base` to each entry and clipping to the 32x32 screen block; `flip` mirrors horizontally, which also toggles each entry's HFLIP bit (0x400).
- loop.c discards a giv when `lifetime * threshold * benefit < insn_count`. Nothing reachable from C addresses that comparison directly, and no spelling probed has moved it.

### Notes

Wave 73 (W73-C). The open lever is register PRESSURE, not spelling -- the ROM's flipped arm reads like a loop strength_reduce declined to reduce because too much was already live. Wave 72 ruled out the cross-arm form of that; what remains untried is pressure INSIDE the flipped inner loop itself. Compare sub_0806B120, matched in wave 73, where switching two stores to bitfields added exactly one live constant and that alone stopped strength_reduce from making an element address a pointer giv -- the same mechanism, in the direction this function needs.
