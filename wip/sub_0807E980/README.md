# sub_0807E980

0x0807E980, 1040 bytes, THUMB, parked.

Best score so far: not measured.

## What it does

One frame of an animated screen run by a proc. It draws the screen's sprites and slides them into place with Interpolate over its frame counter; after 15 frames it loads the screen's sprite graphics and palette (as sub_0807F434 does) and moves the proc to its next step.

## How close it is

Compiles to the right size (1040 bytes); only 6 bytes differ (99.4% match), all in the set-up of the final copy loop: the loop counter's start value is set after the destination address instead of between the source and destination addresses.

## What is left

The original's order means its compiler turned the destination address into a stepping pointer only on its second pass over the loop, after setting up the counter; every spelling so far does it on the first pass. Find what delays it; the recipe for the compiler's per-pass debug dumps that show this is in work/sub_0807E980/NOTES.md.

## Already tried

- Both addresses computed from the loop counter: the compiler always sets them up and steps them in the same order, but the original steps them in the opposite order to their set-up.
- A descending counter (7 down to 0): the counter is set first, but the addresses then step backwards through extra constants; 8 bytes too long.
- Explicit source and destination pointer variables stepped in the body: right order, but they cost registers and the rest of the function shifts (12 bytes too long).
- Binding the buffer address to a local, in several places including inside a call argument: the value gets its register too early and registers shuffle elsewhere; worse.
- The older compiler: worse (14 bytes differ).
- About 150 variants of the current stepping-pointer form, and `do { } while (0)` around parts of the loop: all set the counter last.
- Automatic permuter, several runs (about 50,000 attempts): found one earlier register fix, nothing for this order.

### Best so far

size-exact (1040 bytes), 99.0% identical, 10 of 1040 bytes differ, first difference at +0x370. W81-B re-measured by exit code: unchanged (do/while variant did not exceed it; snapshot restored).

### What still differs

Entirely inside the CpuFastSet double loop at the tail; everything outside it is byte-exact. The ROM initialises src, then the loop COUNTER, then dst -- but increments dst before src. So the giv init order (src,dst) and the giv increment order (dst,src) disagree, and the counter init sits BETWEEN the two giv inits. WAVE 83 (W83-A): comma-depth binding variant authored and compile-checked (not yet trymatched): base=(int)&gUnknown_0200FC50 assigned INSIDE the first sub_08043BA4 third argument (comma creates the reference at a point no statement boundary reaches), loop base then &((u8 *)base)[i*0x100] instead of &gUnknown_0200FC50[i*0x100]. Compiles clean under configured profile; diff its tail against target.s before further levers. Nothing else changed.

### Why it is close

The whole function body, both jump-free arms and every call sequence are exact. The residual is loop-preheader instruction ORDER, not instruction selection: the size is exact and the multiset is right.

### Already ruled out

- old_agbcc -- MEASURED BY THE ORCHESTRATOR, wave 56, and it is WORSE: 98.7% (14 bytes) against the default's 99.0% (10 bytes), and the first difference moves EARLIER, +0x78 against +0x370. Tested because the wave-38 discriminator says the two allocators diverge exactly where a loop body contains a CALL, and this loop body calls CpuFastSet -- so the hypothesis was specific and well-founded. It is still negative.
- -fforce-addr removal -- inert in this address range. data/compiler-overrides.json's own measurement: no promoted file above 0x08063A3C differs without the flag, and this function is at 0x0807E980.
- Both src and dst as loop givs -- when both are givs, agbcc always emits the init order and the increment order the SAME way. Measured both directions: writing dst as a hoisted statement gives src,dst / src,dst; writing neither gives dst,src / dst,src. Neither reproduces the ROM's disagreeing pair.
- check_dbra_loop always emits the counter init LAST, after every giv init -- so the counter cannot be made to land between the two giv inits while both remain givs.
- `gUnknown_0200FC50 + i*0x100 + j*0x400` (plain pointer arithmetic) -- makes agbcc force the symbol into a .rodata address constant and do a DOUBLE load inside the loop, which blocks the src strength reduction entirely. `&gUnknown_0200FC50[...]` does not. Documented in docs/agbcc-codegen.md (wave 56, W56-C).
- decomp-permuter, 12,480 iterations / 300 s from the 98.65% draft. It found the new_var hoist that fixed the src/dst REGISTER assignment (98.65% -> 99.0%) and found nothing for the remaining order.
- W81-B: ROM window re-measured against the diff convention (- = target): preheader order is SRC group (sl-bound base + i<<8), CNT movs r6,#7, DST group (pool 0x06015000 + i<<11); loop bottom steps DST +0x100 then SRC +0x400. The parked description is confirmed.
- W81-B: descending for (j = 7..0) is ACTIVELY HARMFUL -- cnt init moves BEFORE the address groups, the negative pointer steps are emitted as three extra pool words (0x06015700/0xfffffc00/0xffffff00) and the whole outer-loop allocation reshuffles.
- W81-B partially positive result: a source-level do/whose preheader statements written in the ROM's own textual order -- src_p = (int)&gUnknown_0200FC50[i*0x100]; j = 7; vram_p = 0x06015000 + i*0x800; do { CpuFastSet((void*)src_p,(void*)vram_p,0x40); vram_p += 0x100; src_p += 0x400; j--; } while (j >= 0); -- reproduces ALL FOUR orderings exactly (init S,C,D and bottom D,S appear as COMMON diff lines; first spelling ever measured to do so). Residual after it is pure allocation: the base is NOT held in sl across iterations (candidate reloads gUnknown_0200FC50 from the pool each i-iteration instead of reusing the Decompress destination register via mov sl,r4), the i-counter home shifts r5->r6 with its adds-i+1/r8 copy moved after the address groups, and proc access swaps r9<->sl downstream. Anchoring the base through an int local assigned BEFORE the two sub_08043BA4 calls regresses further (registers displace everywhere); a u8*/int base bound immediately before Decompress loses the ldr-r4 passthrough as well. Open question narrowed to: what keeps the Decompress force-address pseudo alive into the loop while three source-level pointer locals exist.
- W85, descending source counter `for (j = 7; j >= 0; j--)` keeping the j-indexed addresses: 95.9% (+8). The counter init position IS fixed (movs r6,#7 first, before the giv inits), but the address givs then fold +7*0x100 into their inits and step NEGATIVE via pool words (0x06015700 init, -0x100 / -0x400 steps) -- the ROM keeps positive steps with no offset fold.
- W85, same with (7 - j) indexing: 83.5%, first difference moves to +0x67 -- breaks the pre-loop region.
- W85, explicit body-stepped pointers (u8 *src / *dst locals, CpuFastSet(src,dst,0x40) then dst += 0x100; src += 0x400; inside the body): 54.1% (+12, first difference +0xc) -- the two extra pointer locals change the frame. The ROM's implied shape (source counter init before the giv inits, positive dst-first steps) is the pointer-variable form, but the frame cost is real; needs a spelling where the pointers do not add pseudos.

### Settled

- Source-level `u8 *` locals incremented in the loop body DO reproduce the ROM's instruction order exactly -- verified, a descending `for (j = 7, dst = ...; j >= 0; j--)` matches the ROM instruction for instruction in that loop. It costs a register: `proc` is evicted from r7, the base address stops living in sl, and that is +12 bytes spread over the rest of the function. Binding the base to its own local to buy sl back made it worse. So the loop shape is SOLVED and the open question is purely the register budget.
- The struct is derived and in the draft (struct Unk807E980, fields at 0x2c/0x30/0x34/0x48/0x4c/0x52/0x58/0x5c/0x60/0x64).
- Everything outside the tail loop is byte-exact and must not be re-derived.

### Why it is parked

W77-M re-measured 2026-08-18 and the park stands: making `src` alone a source-level u8 * with dst left as a giv is 33 bytes; making both src and dst source-level in a descending `for (j = 7, dst = ..., src = ...; j >= 0; j--)` is 477 and no longer size-exact. The register-budget diagnosis reproduces exactly and no new idea was found. Wave 56 (W56-C, one agent on this one function; toolchain axis added by the orchestrator). The open question is narrow and named: what source shape gives source-level ordering in that inner loop WITHOUT spending the extra register. Do NOT hand this back as a generic near-miss -- wave 55 measured rework at 2/10 and both wins carried a correct specific diagnosis. This one has a correct specific diagnosis, so it qualifies, but only with a NEW idea about the register budget, not a repeat of the axes above.

### Wave 82

WAVE 82 (W82-C): W81-B do/while spelling reconstructed from the parked text and re-measured configured; below the old-shape champion, not accepted, draft/best.c restored. It DOES reproduce all four orderings again this wave (preheader init S,C,D; loop-bottom D,S appear as common diff lines) and the residual reproduces as the three recorded facts: base reloads gUnknown_0200FC50 from the pool per i-iteration instead of mov sl,r4; the i+1 giv (adds rN,#1/mov rM,rN) lands AFTER the two address groups instead of right after i-init; proc access swaps r9<->sl downstream. NEW allocation lever measured and CLOSED: binding the VRAM pointer to the dead-by-then x local (decl set back to four ints i/j/x/src_p, identical count to the champion) leaves the residual shape unchanged while allocno homes reshuffle (src_p r5, vram r7, j r4) -- pseudo COUNT is therefore not the blocker; the blocker is which pseudo wins r4/sl across the Decompress call. Variant retained in work/sub_0807E980/w82-snapshot.c.

### Wave 84

WAVE 84 (W84-A): the staged comma-depth lead was MEASURED AND REJECTED twice. Anchor inside the first sub_08043BA4 third argument = miss (base materialises ~4 instructions early as ldr r3/mov sl,r3 before both calls, shifts +4, flips the 08234B10/0200FC50 pool order, swaps globals r4<->r5). Corrected anchor at Decompress's second argument also misses: an explicit int local crossing bl Decompress gets its callee-saved home AT THE ASSIGNMENT, while the ROM homes its CSE pseudo to sl only via the late movs r5,#0; mov sl,r4 pair. The unification mechanism is real; NO binding placement reproduces that home-timing. Comma-depth axis CLOSED on this function.

### Wave 90

WAVE 90 (W90-A): 99.0% -> 99.4%, 10 -> 6 bytes, size-exact, first difference +0x370 (draft = work/sub_0807E980/w90-R6-994.c). The inner loop is a WALKER plus a GIV OF THE WALKER: `for (j = 0, new_var = 0; j < 8; j++) { x = (0x06015000 + (i * 0x800)) + new_var; CpuFastSet(&gUnknown_0200FC50[(i * 0x100) + (j * 0x400)], (void *) x, 0x40); new_var += 0x100; }`. The dst giv's increment then goes before the walker's body increment, i.e. before the src giv's (which goes before j++): the ROM's dst-then-src loop bottom, which two givs of one biv can never give (they increment in init order). The D sum in its own statement before the call puts i<<11 ahead of i<<8 as in the ROM (inline in the call: 8 bytes). ONLY RESIDUAL: `movs r6,#7` after the dst init instead of between src and dst. RTL dumps (-dL/-dG, recipe in NOTES.md) pin it: i+1 and i<<8 are GCSE/PRE insertions; src is a pass-1 giv init; `j = 7` is check_dbra_loop in the SECOND loop pass, which runs before that pass's giv reduction; so the ROM's dst init is a giv first reduced in PASS 2, and every spelling measured reduces it in pass 1. 144 compiled variants (D temp x/fresh/inline x walker increment end/for-increment/first x init for-init/statement x do/while(0) on each of three statements) all emit the counter last. Ruled out this wave: the matched twin c_080790D0.c's walker form (+12, proc evicted to r9 and p rematerialised per outer iteration; with/without p, int walkers, off walker all the same), dst-walker-only (96.5%, dst init is SOURCE and lands first), src as a source walker with dst a giv (85.7%), do/while(0) anywhere in the body (byte-identical to R6). Permuter: directed 9,242 it from the old base, directed 14,347 it from R6 (PERM_GENERAL walker forms + RANDOMIZE; w90-R6-directed.perm.txt), and undirected 13,173 it from R6: nothing.
