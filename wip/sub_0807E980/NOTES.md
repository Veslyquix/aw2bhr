# sub_0807E980 notes

## W84-A (wave 84, agent A)

Draft state at wave start: champion old-shape draft restored before this agent
(`sub_0807E980.c` == w83-snapshot.c == w83-best-before.c == best.c,
MD5 ED91F14A..., 99.04% / 10 bytes / first diff +0x370). The "DRAFT GONE"
preflight flag was stale.

**The staged lead WAS measured now (twice), both under configured profile.**

1. `w84-comma-depth.c` -- wave 83's exact spelling: comma binding
   `base = (int)&gUnknown_0200FC50` inside the FIRST `sub_08043BA4` third
   argument, loop base `&((u8 *)base)[(i*0x100)+(j*0x400)]`. try_match: MISS.
   The base pseudo materializes ~4 instructions too early
   (`ldr r3,=gU; mov sl,r3` lands BEFORE the first sub_08043BA4 where ROM has
   `ldr r4,=gU` only after the second call), shifts everything +4 bytes, flips
   the .rodata pool order (candidate 0200FC50@400/08234B10@404 vs ROM
   08234B10@400/0200FC50@404) and swaps r4<->r5 through the whole trailing
   sprite loop.

2. `w84-decomp-comma.c` -- correction probe: same comma moved INTO
   Decompress's second argument
   (`Decompress(gUnknown_08234B10, (base = (int)&gUnknown_0200FC50,
   (void *)base))`). Isolated compile_probe shows correct unification and
   pool order for the loop itself; full-function try_match: MISS. Same
   defect class: because an explicit int local crosses `bl Decompress`,
   reload assigns its callee-saved home AT THE ASSIGNMENT (`mov sl,r3`
   immediately after `ldr r3,=gU`, before the call), while the ROM keeps the
   value in scratch r4 through the call and only homes it to sl via the late
   copy sequence `movs r5,#0; mov sl,r4`. Plus the same global allocno
   reshuffle (r4<->r5 in both sprite loops).

Conclusions:
- The comma MECHANISM is confirmed: with any explicit binding, one pseudo
  carries &gUnknown_0200FC50 into the loop with no per-iteration pool reload --
  the thing three waves asked for does happen.
- But every explicit-binding anchor that was authored creates the pseudo as a
  USER LOCAL whose home is chosen at the assignment; the ROM shape has NO user
  variable there at all -- CSE unifies the two references invisibly and only
  adopts sl at the loop preheader. No placement of an explicit binding can
  reproduce that home-timing; this axis is CLOSED for spellings of the form
  measured (anchor = first sub_08043BA4 third arg, anchor = Decompress second
  arg).
- Draft restored to the champion (verified by hash). best.json untouched
  (99.04). Park entry stands; nothing new beyond the two measured numbers
  above to add to it.

## W90-A (wave 90, agent A) -- 99.0% -> 99.4%, 10 -> 6 bytes, size-exact

Active draft = `w90-R6-994.c` (configured: 1040/1040, 6 of 1040 differ, first
difference +0x370). `w90-start.c` is the 99.0% champion this wave began from.

**The inner loop is a WALKER + GIV pair, not two givs of j.** New source:

    for (j = 0, new_var = 0; j < 8; j++)
    {
        x = (0x06015000 + (i * 0x800)) + new_var;
        CpuFastSet(&gUnknown_0200FC50[(i * 0x100) + (j * 0x400)], (void *) x, 0x40);
        new_var += 0x100;
    }

- `new_var` is a source walker (biv, step 0x100) and the VRAM address is a
  GIV OF THE WALKER, not of j. strength_reduce then inserts the dst increment
  before the walker's own (body) increment, i.e. BEFORE the src giv's increment
  (which goes before `j++`). That reproduces the ROM's dst-then-src loop bottom,
  which no two-givs-of-j spelling can (both givs of one biv always increment in
  giv-list order, the same order as their inits). R1 (the walker sum inline in
  the call) = 8 bytes; R6 (the sum in its own statement BEFORE the call) = 6
  bytes, because computing `i * 0x800` first puts `lsls r1,r5,#11` ahead of
  `lsls r0,r5,#8` as in the ROM.
- The ONLY residual left: `movs r6,#7` (counter init) sits after the dst init
  where the ROM has it between src and dst. RTL dumps (`-dL`) settle where
  each preheader insn comes from: `i + 1` and `i << 8` are GCSE/PRE insertions
  (present in the `.gcse` dump) at the end of the block before the inner loop;
  the src init is a RUN-1 giv init; the counter `j = 7` is written by
  check_dbra_loop in the SECOND loop pass (`flag_rerun_loop_opt`), and
  check_dbra_loop runs BEFORE that pass's own giv reduction. So in the ROM the
  dst init, emitted after `j = 7`, must be a giv reduced in RUN 2, and its
  increment still precedes src's, so its biv is not j. In every spelling
  measured here dst is reduced in run 1. That is the open question, and it is
  now narrow: what makes the walker's giv "not worth while" (or not a giv) in
  pass 1 but reduced in pass 2? LICM's threshold test (13 x savings x life vs
  insn_count 19 -> 16) has no integer landing between the two passes for a
  life-1 movable, so it is not the obvious one.

Measured, all configured, all worse or equal (drafts in the scratch variants,
not kept): the matched twin `c_080790D0.c`'s full walker form (src/dst walkers,
`k = i * 0x800`, descending source `j = 7`) = +12, 54.1%: the three extra user
pseudos push `proc` out of r7 (r9) and `p = gUnknown_0200FC50` is
rematerialised from the pool every outer iteration instead of held in sl; with
p / without p / int walkers / `off` walker all identical or worse. dst walker
only, src giv of j (`I`) = 96.5% but dst init is SOURCE (first in the
preheader); walker counting by 1 (`* 0x100` at the use) = R1; walker in the
for-increment = 98.0%; do/while(0) around any one of the three body statements
or the whole body = byte-identical to R6 (jump deletes the zero-trip loop
before loop opt, so it cannot defer a reduction to pass 2); src as a source
walker with dst a giv of the walker (descending or ascending j) = 85.7%.

Permuter: directed run from the old 99.0% base (96 PERM_GENERAL bases x
randomize over the loop, 9,242 iterations, 900 s) found nothing; the walker
form was found by hand after reading the RTL dumps.

**Tooling added this wave: RTL dumps.** `agbcc` accepts gcc 2.95's `-d`
flags. Preprocess with the same cpp line as `permuter/compile.sh` into a file
and run `agbcc x.i ... -O2 -dr -dL -dG -dc -o x.s` in a scratch dir: you get
`x.i.rtl` (expand), `x.i.gcse`, `x.i.loop` (with the per-loop biv/giv log for
BOTH loop passes: "giv ... reduced to", "Can reverse loop", "not worth
while"), `x.i.combine`. This answers "which pass wrote this insn" directly.

**Run 3 (wave 90, W90-A):** undirected 900 s from the 99.4% R6 draft
(`w90-R6-994.c`, base score 60), 13,173 iterations: nothing better. Totals on
this function this wave: three runs, ~36.8k iterations, no permuter gain; the
10 -> 6 byte step was the hand-found walker form. The directed sources are kept
as `w90-directed.perm.txt` and `w90-R6-directed.perm.txt`. Draft left at 99.4%
(`sub_0807E980.c` == `w90-R6-994.c`).
