/* PARKED at 392 of 400 bytes (wave 15, C). Structure, control flow, both `.LC`
 * pool spellings and every relocation are right; the candidate is 8 bytes SHORT
 * and the missing instructions are all zero-extensions agbcc elides here and
 * did not elide in the ROM.
 *
 * `ax` and `by` are `int` with an explicit `(u16)` cast at each use, NOT `u16`
 * locals -- that one change is worth 16 of the 24 bytes this was short before.
 * A `u16` local is a promoted SImode pseudo, so reading it costs nothing and
 * combine then folds the `* 2` of the definition into the `* 2` of the pointer
 * scaling and emits a single `lsls #2`; the ROM keeps `lsls rN, ax, #0x10` once
 * and `lsrs rM, rN, #0xf` at every use, which only the explicit cast produces.
 * A STRAIGHT-LINE probe cannot tell the two spellings apart -- both fold there
 * -- so this has to be measured in the real function.
 *
 * What is still missing is the same effect on `id`: the ROM stores it with
 * `lsls #0x10; lsrs #0x10` after the `ldrb` and this draft elides that pair.
 * `int id` with `(u16)`/`(s16)` casts fixes those 4 bytes and costs more
 * elsewhere (it re-enables the ax/by folding), so it is not the answer either;
 * the two want different spellings of the same idea and I did not find one that
 * holds both. Ruled out: old_agbcc (identical size), and ax/by as unused
 * parameters overwritten on entry (identical output -- flow deletes the dead
 * incoming copy and the promotion survives). */
