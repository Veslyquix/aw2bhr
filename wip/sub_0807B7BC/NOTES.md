# sub_0807B7BC — 144 bytes against 156, −12, 9.0%. Waves 48 (W48-E) and 58 (W58-C).

Ignore the 9.0%: it is positional. Being 12 bytes short shifts every byte after
the prologue. The instruction stream is semantically correct end to end —
statement order, the glyph-table walk, the VRAM destination arithmetic, the u16
accumulator, the out-parameter store and the `(u16)` return are all right.

## Wave 58 (W58-C): it is NOT a missing induction variable, and that was measured

W58-B's reverse preheader rule predicts that a loop draft 12 bytes SHORT is
missing a second source induction variable, and this function's ROM has exactly
the shape the rule names — `adds r6, r4, #1` at the top of the outer body,
`adds r4, r6, #0` at the bottom. **It is the compiler's own W47-D increment
hoist, and the unmodified draft already emits it.** From a `compile_probe` of
the draft below, verbatim:

    ldr  r4, .L16          ; g = gUnknown_08616194
    ldrb r1, [r4]
    add  r0, r5, #0x1      ; <-- the hoist of `str++`, unauthored
    mov  r8, r0
    ...
    mov  r5, r8            ; <-- and the copy back

Authoring it anyway (`u8 *next; next = str + 1; ... str = next;`) made it
**worse**: 144 B / 9.0% → 140 B / 3.8%. The authored pseudo takes r8 and evicts
`outWidths` and `total` into two caller-save slots where the ROM has one.

The general form of this is now a chapter in `docs/agbcc-codegen.md`
("A SHORT loop draft is almost never a missing induction variable"): the
compiler's hoist **coalesces** the incremented value back into the counter's
register, a source variable cannot. Position at the top of the body does not
discriminate; the copy-back at the bottom does — and here the draft already has
both.

## The actual residual: a callee-saved / caller-saved split

Same eight live values in both. The ROM spends THREE high registers and
caller-saves one value; the draft spends TWO and caller-saves two.

    ROM   push {r4-r7,lr}; mov r7,sl; mov r6,sb; mov r5,r8; push {r5,r6,r7}
          sub sp,#4
          r4=str  r5=g  r6=str+1  r7=tile  r8=outWidths  sb=total  sl=outTotal
          r2=count, caller-saved around Decompress (one slot)
    here  push {r4-r7,lr}; mov r7,sb; mov r6,r8; push {r6,r7}
          sub sp,#8
          r5=str  r4=g  r8=str+1  r6=tile  r7=count  r9=outTotal
          outWidths and total both caller-saved (two slots)

The 12 bytes are the extra push/pop pair, the extra `mov` at each high-register
use, and the second caller-save pair. The inverted loop-test placement noted in
wave 48 (the ROM duplicates the OUTER test and shares the INNER one; the draft
does the opposite) falls out of the same allocation.

The competition is `str+1` versus `count` for the fourth low callee-saved
register. The ROM gives it to `str+1` (2 references) over `count` (5), which is
backwards from allocno priority — that is the fact a next attempt has to
explain.

## Spellings already measured — do not re-test

All of these compile to byte-identical output:

1. inner loop as `for (g = tbl; g->unk00 != 0; g++)` (this draft)
2. inner loop as `while (g->unk00 != 0) { ...; g++; }`
3. outer loop as `if (*str != 0) { do { ... } while (*str != 0); }` — an explicit
   attempt to author the ROM's duplicated outer test; gcc normalises it straight
   back
4. local declaration order permuted (`u16 total;` first vs `int count;` first) —
   so the allocno tie-break is not the lever
5. (wave 58) assignment order `count = 0; total = 0;` vs the reverse

And measured as strictly worse:

6. (wave 58) `u8 *next;` authored, with `str = next;` at the bottom — 140 B, 3.8%

## The prototype is correct and was verified, not assumed

W48-C declared this from one call site as
`u16 (u8 *, u16 *, u8 *, int, void *)`. The body reads only FOUR argument
registers and never touches `[sp,#0x24]`, so the fifth looks invented from
inside the function — but BOTH ROM call sites (0x0806AB24 and the one at
0x0807BC00 in `code-0806CFC8.s`) push a fifth stack argument before the `bl`.
The parameter is real and simply dead in the body. Leave the declaration alone.

## Next lever

A register-allocation residual, but NOT the permuter's stated case — the sizes
differ, and a 6-instruction prologue delta is the shape the permuter is
documented to be useless on. Attack the pressure: find the spelling that makes
agbcc want `sl`.
