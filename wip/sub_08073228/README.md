### Best so far

29.1% (wave 46, W46-H; was 12.7%)

### What still differs

Size-EXACT at 220 bytes and the residual is confined to the inner search loop. Byte-exact already: the whole prologue, the 0x20 frame, the ENTIRE stack-slot map ([sp,#0]=a1, [sp,#4]=a2, [sp,#8]=a4, [sp,#0xc]=acc, [sp,#0x10]=proc+0x2a, [sp,#0x14]=a3*0x20, [sp,#0x18]=proc+0x46, [sp,#0x1c]=i*2), every callee-saved assignment (r5=i, r6=i*0x100, r8=i*0x10, sb=acc<<16, sl=i+1, r4=j*8), the CpuFastSet call, both proc stores, the acc update and the whole epilogue. TWO residuals remain. (1) LOOP ROTATION: the ROM's inner search is UNROTATED -- exit test at the top, unconditional `b` at the bottom, with a dead `adds r0, r4, #0` ahead of the test -- and it strength-reduces j*8 to `adds r4, #8`. The candidate comes out ROTATED (peeled test, bottom-tested `bne`) and recomputes `lsls r4, r3, #3` each iteration. (2) The ROM's compare is `cmp r3, r7`, i.e. `c` on the LEFT, and the VRAM destination groups as (i*0x100 + 0x06010000) + a3*0x20 with the 0x06010000 pool word loaded INSIDE the loop; the candidate lets LICM hoist `0x06010000 + a3*0x20` together as one invariant. NEXT LEVER -- one question only: make agbcc leave the inner search loop UNROTATED. `while (tbl[j].unk00 != c) j++;`, `for (;;) { if (...) break; j++; }` and the for(;;) with a leading `k = j * 8;` all rotate. The ROM's dead `adds r0, r4, #0` ahead of the exit test is the tell that a source statement sits there. Fixing rotation is expected to fix the compare operand order and the j*8 strength reduction with it, because both moved together in every probe.

### Why it is close

Everything outside the inner search loop is byte-identical, including the frame size and every stack slot -- the two things the previous 12.7% attempt got wrong. The score is positional and understates it.

### Already ruled out

- PROTOTYPE. `void sub_08073228(const void *, void *, u16, ProcPtr)` is correct; two callers of sub_08073304 matched byte-for-byte this wave corroborate the chain. Do not re-derive it.
- `u16 acc` with an explicit (s16) cast at the read -- convert_to_integer distributes the narrowing over the `+` and deletes it. Not the spelling.
- gUnknown_08614028 as a second object -- it is this table's `unk04` member (include/unknown-globals.h:15243). The candidate's `.word gUnknown_08614024+4` against the ROM's `.word gUnknown_08614028+0` is the documented same-address false mismatch, NOT a real difference.
- The flat `*((u8 *)gUnknown_08614024 + k)` table spelling: it gets the compare operand order right but DROPS the frame back to 0x1c and puts a1 in sl. The struct-index spelling is required for the frame.
- Swapping the compare to `c == tbl[j].unk00` on its own: same effect -- correct `cmp` operand order but the frame collapses to 0x1c (216 bytes, 20.0%). The compare order and the frame are COUPLED; do not chase them separately.
- TOOLCHAIN. Not the axis: sub_08073714 and two block neighbours matched on the default toolchain this wave, and data/compiler-overrides.json has no entry anywhere in 0x08073.
- The wave-46 orchestrator's advice to 'aim for eight distinct stack-resident locals' -- REFUTED, see settled_by_this_attempt.

### Settled

- `short acc` -- a SIGNED short LOCAL -- is what produces the ROM's `lsls #16; asrs #16` on every read and `lsls #16; lsrs #16` on every write. agbcc's PROMOTE_MODE forces sub-word LOCALS (not just parameters) to zero-extended SImode, so a signed short local sign-extends at each read and truncates at each write. This closes the previous attempt's 'defect 2' outright, and it explains for free why the ROM computes acc<<16 at the TOP of the loop body and the `asrs` at the BOTTOM: the two halves straddle the CpuFastSet call because the value must be carried in a callee-saved register.
- Using the PARAMETERS DIRECTLY with casts at each use (`((const u8 *)a1)[i]`, `((struct Unk73228Proc *)a4)->unk58`) rather than through aliasing locals `str`/`proc` is what produces the ROM's 0x20 frame with a1, a2 and a4 spilled to [sp,#0]/[sp,#4]/[sp,#8] in PARAMETER ORDER. With the aliasing locals, a1 stays in sl and the frame is 0x1c. The casts are byte-neutral; the aliasing locals are not.
- Adding `k = j * 8;` as the first statement of a `for (;;)` inner loop, with k used after the loop for the `.unk04` access, is what puts a real insn ahead of the exit test and makes j*8 survive the loop in r4.
- The stack-slot map, the frame size and every callee-saved register assignment are now exactly the ROM's, so the remaining work is ONLY the inner loop's shape, not allocation.
- [sp,#0x10], [sp,#0x14], [sp,#0x18] and [sp,#0x1c] are LICM hoists and strength_reduce giv temporaries and must NOT be authored as source locals. The 'eight distinct stack-resident locals' reading of the slot map counted four compiler-generated temporaries as source variables; only a1, a2, a4 and acc are author-level.

### Why it is parked

2 try_match attempts spent; W46-H had a single round and three other functions.

### Wave 86

WAVE 86 (W86-C then W86-G): the pre-registered hypothesis 'the inner search is a LABEL/GOTO LOOP' is CONFIRMED (W46-B chapter): with `k = j * 8; p = tbl + k; _search: if (c == *p) goto _found; k += 8; p += 8; j++; goto _search;` the loop is UNROTATED (test at top, `b` at bottom), the compare is `cmp rC, r7` with c on the LEFT, j*8 is the ROM's `adds r4,#8`, and the 0x06010000 pool word stays inside the loop -- all three wave-46 facts moved together as that park predicted; every for/while spelling rotates because it emits NOTE_INSN_LOOP_BEG. Everything settled in wave 46 (struct-index table spelling, parameters used directly with casts, `short acc`) is retained. New state, configured: 216/220 (-4), 21.8% (positional; the divergence moved from inside the loop to +0xa), draft = the goto-loop form (wave-46 draft preserved as w86-start.c). W86-G answered the follow-up: the ROM carries BOTH strides as pointers (r2 = `adds r2,r4,r7` once before the label, then `adds r2,#8`; no per-iteration re-add), so the draft's three strides j/k/p are exactly the ROM's and 'index by k with no pointer local' is a different loop. Also refuted: `int inext = i + 1;` at the body top (size-neutral, marginally worse -- gcc already emits `adds r2,r5,#1 / mov r9,r2` from a plain i++, so the ROM's `adds r3,r5,#1 / mov sl,r3` is not a source construct); `m = k;` at the loop top (coalesces, deleted); moving `c = a1[i]` after the k/p init (reorders three insns only). THE 4 BYTES ARE NOT THE FRAME: `sub sp,#32` vs `#28` costs nothing and the a1 spill is size-neutral (three `ldr rX,[sp]` = three `mov rX,sl`); counted off the diff they are `mov r8,r7` (parking i*0x10 in a high register), `ldr r0,[sp,#28]` (reloading the spilled i*2 after the call) and the dead `adds r0,r4,#0`, less the draft's 2 bytes of pool alignment. So the residual is a SPILL-CHOICE TIE between i*2 and i*0x10 -- each computed once at the body top, each read once after the call in the SAME statement (`proc->unk2a[i] = i * 0x10 + 4`: the address needs i*2, the value needs i*0x10), created in the same order in both; one takes a high register, one the stack, and ROM and draft disagree which. Order-correct, slot-wrong = the permuter's own case, and NO permuter run has ever been taken against the goto-loop draft (the recorded negatives predate it) -- that is the named next step.

### Wave 87

WAVE 87 (W87-B): 21.8%/216 (-4) -> 76.4% SIZE-EXACT 220/220 (draft; best.c 83.2%), first difference +0x19; draft REPLACED (goto-loop wave-86 draft in w87-start.c / _w87_gotoloop.c; the tidy 76.4% splice in _w87_76pct.c). THE RESIDUAL WAS NOT THE i*2 / i*0x10 SPILL TIE: read off target.s, the ROM SPILLS the PARAMETER a1 to [sp,#0] and reloads it at both uses while the candidate kept a1 in sl for the whole function -- that was the entire -4 and the +0xa first difference (`sub sp,#0x20` vs `#0x1c`). Both use exactly three hi registers (ROM r8=i*0x10, sb=acc<<16, sl=i+1; candidate r8=acc<<16, r9=i+1, sl=a1, i*0x10 on the stack): a THREE-WAY contest for the third hi register between a1 and i*0x10, and the loser's slot shifts the whole stack map. W86-C second delay lever (`t = i * 0x10;`) REFUTED: it MOVES the computation to the top of the body and does not touch the a1 decision. `*&a1`, `*(const void *const *)&a1` inline and a dead `ap = &a1;` all fold away (the address must be READ THROUGH); a static-inline helper around `i * 0x10 + 4` or around the whole indexed store leaves a1 in sl (that lever re-cuts live ranges among locals/temporaries, it does not dislodge a PARAMETER). Four chained permuter links from the goto-loop draft (first ever on it): 21.4 -> 83.2, fourth link flat -- the frame, the parameter spill order and the size are now the ROM's and what is left is 52 bytes INSIDE the loop (loop shape and in-loop allocation). remaining_diff/axes_ruled_out above are superseded. Next is a CONSTRUCT, not permuter time: the ROM's dead `adds r0,r4,#0` at the top of the search loop -- wave 46 produced exactly it with `k = j * 8;` as the first statement of a `for(;;)` body, the wave-86 goto rewrite dropped it, the permuter's `j = j * 8; k = j;` echoes it. Untested: a goto loop that RE-DERIVES k at the top of each pass rather than only stepping it, tried on top of the 76.4% draft (whose old negatives are void).
