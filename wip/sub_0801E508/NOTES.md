# sub_0801E508 — parked at 15.7%, size -44 (932 vs 976), wave 54, W54-G

**The decomposition is settled and the whole `bl` sequence is structurally
right.** The score is positional noise from the -44. One `try_match` spent.

## What the function is

The affine sibling of `sub_0801E9B0`: same subsystem, same `a1 + n > 0x80`
guard, same `gUnknown_03002520[a1 * 4]` destination walked 8 bytes per record,
same "count halfword then N records" input. It rotates each OAM cell by
`gUnknown_0200F720[a5]`, which is reached as `s16 *e` — the idiom the promoted
sibling `src/decomp/c_0801E18C.c:32` already uses on the same record:

    e[0] = x scale   e[1] = y scale   e[2] = angle
    x = (int)( z*cos(e2)/e0 + v*sin(e2)/e0 + a2 - f(u) )
    y = (int)(-z*sin(e2)/e1 + v*cos(e2)/e1 + a3 - f(w) )

`sub_0808B91C` is cosf to `sub_0808B710`'s sinf — they are always called as a
matched pair on the same angle, which is what identifies B91C.
`(w & 0x300) == 0x300` selects the full-size arm; the `else` arm is the same
code with every `sub_0801E3B4` result halved (`lsrs #31; adds; asrs #1`).

## Two readouts that are already confirmed and cost nothing to reuse

- **`sub_0801E3B4` is pre-expanded to the head of its statement.** Written
  inline as `- (float)sub_0801E3B4(u)`, gcc 2.x's `preexpand_calls` hoists the
  call above the whole float chain and leaves the `/ 2` (in the else arm) at the
  point of use. That reproduces the ROM exactly, and it does NOT need a separate
  `k` local. Confirmed in the candidate's output.
- **`(s16)member` on a `u16` struct member compiles to `ldrsh`** — probed
  directly, see the new chapter in `docs/agbcc-codegen.md`. So
  `gUnknown_0200F720` did NOT need retyping, and the plain (uncast) `u16` read
  is refutable: it emits `ldrsh` PLUS a `cmp; bge; __addsf3 65536.0`
  unsigned-correction the ROM does not have.

## The remaining residual: too many simultaneously live values

The ROM keeps `e` in r9, `w` in r8, `u` in r7 and `v` in sl, and its frame is
36 bytes. The candidate spills `e` and `w` to stack and gets a 32-byte frame —
one fewer slot but two more spills, so the allocation diverges from `+0xa`.

Two concrete symptoms, both visible in the diff:

1. **`sub_0808B710(...)` / `sub_0808B91C(...)` are shared between the x and y
   statements in the candidate and RE-CALLED in the ROM.** The x statement needs
   cos-then-sin and the y statement sin-then-cos on the same angle, so the two
   statements offer each other identical subexpressions. Whatever keeps them
   apart in the ROM also frees the two registers the candidate is holding them
   in — this is almost certainly the whole -44.
2. `n` is spilled eagerly by the candidate; the ROM keeps it in r2 until the
   loop preheader (`str r2,[sp,#0xc]` after the `e` setup). Likewise the ROM
   writes `p` as a copy-then-add (`adds r0,r3,#0; adds r0,#2`), keeping `a4`
   live, where the candidate does a destructive `adds r3,#2`.

## Next things to try, in order

- Attack (1) first: it is the wave-35 W35-C family (two arms/statements the ROM
  keeps separate). Try writing the four angle terms so the two statements are
  not textually identical, or binding the sin/cos results to per-statement
  locals so the live ranges cannot merge.
- If (1) alone does not close it, (2) says the source probably does not reuse
  one variable for both the bound and the counter — try `for (i = n; i != 0;
  i--)` with a distinct `i` rather than `while (--n != 0)`.
- Above 256 bytes the brief mandates a permuter run before a third hand
  rewrite; it has not been run.

## Wave 65 final probe

A grouped-accumulator rewrite forced each soft-float term into its own statement,
precomputed the two `sub_0801E3B4` results, preserved `a4` with `p = a4; p++;`,
and used a distinct loop counter. It moved the wrong way: 900/976 bytes (-76)
with a 28-byte frame, versus this draft's 932/976 (-44) and 32-byte frame; the
ROM uses 36. The rewrite did not merely fail to break the unwanted reuse: it
shortened the live ranges further. The honest expression draft remains active.

## Header work done for this function, all swept for callers

`sub_0801E3B4`, `sub_0808B710` (promoted-but-undeclared) and `sub_0808B91C`
(draft only) declared in `include/unknown-functions.h`. `sub_0801E508` is the
only caller of any of them outside their own files.
