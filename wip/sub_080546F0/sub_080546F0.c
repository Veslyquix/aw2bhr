#include "global.h"

/* Wave 56, W56-O.  STATE: +8 bytes, 26.8% (from +40 / 20.8%).  Wave 72
 * reverified the same configured 1068/1060-byte, 26.8% fixpoint.  NOT a "could
 * not work out how" -- the SHAPE is complete and was read out statement by
 * statement against the ROM: three loop nests plus the CpuFastSet tail, every
 * global, every member offset, every loop bound and every store ORDER already
 * agree.  No codegen question is open about WHAT the function does.  The
 * residual is register allocation, and it has one seed and three symptoms.
 *
 * THE SEED is that agbcc puts the shared loop counter in r5/r6 here and in r7
 * in the ROM, so every scratch below it shifts by one and the frame carries
 * three more spill slots (0x54 against the ROM's 0x48).  Frame size is NOT a
 * code-size term, so the +8 is entirely the symptoms:
 *   - loop 1's increment block needs two `movs rN,#2` where the ROM shares one
 *     (+2), because the register holding the constant is reallocated;
 *   - loop 2 keeps `&gUnknown_02029808[i]` as its own pointer induction
 *     variable stepping by 108, where the ROM reuses the `muls #0x6c` product
 *     it already computed for gUnknown_02029816 and adds the bare symbol
 *     (+2 for the extra `movs`/`add` pair);
 *   - `gUnknown_02029664 = 0` reuses the halfword zero (`strb r1,[r0]`) where
 *     the ROM materialises a second one (`movs r0,#0; strb r0,[r1]`) (-2), and
 *     `gUnknown_020296B0[i]` reaches the element with `add r0,ip` where the ROM
 *     copies ip to a lo register first (-2).
 *
 * MEASURED AND RULED OUT, so do not spend attempts on them again:
 *   - the eight `|= 0xffff` rows.  See the comment below and the wave-56 W56-O
 *     chapter of docs/agbcc-codegen.md; the view-struct spelling is the only
 *     one of six tested that reproduces `ldrh; orrs; strh`.
 *   - the cast SITE.  Casting the array base instead of the element address
 *     was measured at +28 bytes; casting the element's member address costs a
 *     pool word.  The current spelling is the best of the three.
 *   - gUnknown_02028E5C's pair of stores.  `q = gUnknown_02028E5C[i]; q[0]=0;
 *     q[1]=0;` gives the ROM's `strh [r0]; strh [r0,#2]`; the direct
 *     `[i][0]`/`[i][1]` spelling splits the base and does not.
 *   - the frame.  Two `u32` locals in this order, sp+0 then sp+4, is right;
 *     the `mov r0,sp; adds r0,#4` hoisted to the top of the function is
 *     purge_addressof and must not be authored.
 *
 * Wave 72 tested whether reusing `i`/`j` across the loop nests is the seed.
 * Splitting all four outer counters over-corrects to 1044 bytes (-16), and
 * splitting the two inner counters as well reaches 1040 (-20). Individually,
 * splitting outer loops 1/2/3/4 gives +8/+16/-16/-36; splitting either inner
 * counter gives +12. The shared-counter web controls the spill surplus, but
 * none of the selective source-reachable splits lands on the ROM's middle
 * allocation. Wave 78 reverified the configured +8-section-byte (+6 code-byte)
 * residual and retained this higher-scoring draft. */
/* Eight halfword rows in this subsystem are declared `s16` in
 * include/unknown-globals.h, but sub_080546F0 clears them with `x |= 0xffff`
 * and the ROM's `ldrh; orrs; strh` against a POOLED 0x0000ffff can only be
 * produced by an UNSIGNED 16-bit lvalue: on an s16 lvalue agbcc's
 * shorten_binary_op folds the whole expression to the constant -1 and emits a
 * bare `strh` (measured -- see docs/agbcc-codegen.md, wave 56, W56-O).  The
 * shared declarations are left alone; these local views name the same storage
 * as u16 so the ACCESS, and only the access, is unsigned.
 *
 * The cast has to be on the array BASE.  A cast on the ELEMENT ADDRESS
 * (`*(u16 *)&x`, or `((struct C *)&x)->v`) reproduces the unsignedness but
 * folds the member offset into the literal-pool word, which the ROM does not
 * do -- it keeps the bare symbol and reaches the member with `adds rB,#N`. */
