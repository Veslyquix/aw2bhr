# sub_08068038

0x08068038, 172 bytes, THUMB, parked.

Best score so far: 36.6% (best.c).

## What it does

Draws a string as sprite glyphs and returns how many characters it drew. For each character it scans the table of 8-byte records gUnknown_08581160 (character code, then compressed graphics) from the global cursor gUnknown_0202F208 until the character equals the code or the code plus 0x20, and decompresses that glyph into sprite tile memory at 0x06010000 + index * 512 + a2 * 32; a 0xFF code ends the table and falls back to entry 12's graphics.

## How close it is

Compiles 4 bytes too long (176 against 172), 36.6% of bytes in place. Control flow, branches and constants all match; the difference is register choice: the ROM keeps the string pointer on the stack and holds the table and cursor addresses in registers for the whole function, while the draft reloads both addresses inside the search loop and puts a2 * 32 on the stack.

## What is left

Get the table and cursor addresses loaded once before the outer loop while keeping the goto search loop. Not yet tried: bind both addresses to locals before the loop and leave the first `gUnknown_0202F208 = 0` store using the plain global, the pattern that recovered a register copy in sub_08061DCC.

## Already tried

- The search loop as `for (;;)` with two breaks: the compiler repeats the 0xFF test at the loop bottom. The goto form fixed 24 bytes (kept).
- Dropping the `next` and `dst` locals: 156 bytes (16 short); the compiler turns the string index and the destination into walking pointers the ROM does not have.
- A goto loop with a plain `i++`: the same walking-pointer problem.
- `continue` against `goto bottom`: byte-identical.
- Chasing the extra constant gUnknown_08581164 on its own: it is the table address plus 4 and follows from which register holds the table address.

### Best so far

36.6% identical, candidate 176 bytes (+4), first difference at +0xc -- in the frame. First measurement of this function; wave 59 (W59-E).

### What still differs

ONE ALLOCATION DECISION, and every other hunk follows from it. ROM: the str parameter is SPILLED to a stack slot ('str r0,[sp]', reloaded at all three uses), a2 * 32 lives in sb, &gUnknown_08581160 in sl, &gUnknown_0202F208 in r8 (held for the whole function) and i in ip -- four HI registers plus one stack slot. Candidate: str in sl, a2 * 32 spilled to the stack, and &gUnknown_0202F208 rematerialised from the pool after the call instead of held. The candidate carries one live value fewer than the original.

### Why it is close

The whole control-flow skeleton is byte-exact in place: the outer test, the inner scan loop over the global cursor, the 'goto advance' re-entry, the short-circuit ||, the CROSS-JUMP MERGE that gives both arms one shared 'bl Decompress', the 'ldr r0,[r0,#0x64]' fold for the sentinel's entry-12 data, and the epilogue. Every branch and every constant agrees. The scan cursor genuinely lives in memory -- gUnknown_0202F208 is zeroed before the loop, loaded at the top of every inner iteration and stored back on increment -- and no local reproduces that.

### Already ruled out

- Wave 59 (W59-E): DO NOT chase the '=gUnknown_08581164' pool word. It is not a separate global and not a second table: '&tbl[g].data' is '(g * 8) + (base + 4)', and which spelling agbcc picks is decided by where the base landed. With the base in a HI register (the ROM, sl) there is no 'adds rD,rHI,#4' available, so it forces a fresh pool word holding base+4; with the base in a LOW register (the candidate, r6) CSE reaches it with 'adds r0,r6,#4'. The pool word and the register assignment are ONE fact.
- Wave 59 (W59-E): dropping the 'next' and 'dst' binding locals -- writing 'i++' after the Decompress call and the destination expression inline at the call site, on the theory that both are inner-loop-invariant and so would be LICM-hoisted anyway. STRICTLY AND BADLY WORSE: 156 bytes (-16), 11.6%. Without the locals gcc strength-reduces BOTH walks, turning str into a walking pointer ('adds r4,#1') and the destination into a giv ('movs r0,#128' / 'lsls r0,#2' / 'adds r6,r6,r0'). The ROM carries NEITHER and recomputes 'str + i' and 'i * 512' from the index on every outer iteration. So the two locals are load-bearing. This is the sub_0800CAA0 direction of the induction-variable axis -- the CANDIDATE carrying givs the ROM does not -- and it is a useful counter-example to the usual 'binding locals are punctuation, split them' advice: here REMOVING binding locals cost 16 bytes.
