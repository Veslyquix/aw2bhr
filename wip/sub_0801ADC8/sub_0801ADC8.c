/* PARKED at 34.5% / -4 bytes -- wave 56, W56-F. READ THE SIZE, NOT THE SCORE:
 * the candidate is exactly FOUR bytes short and those four bytes are ONE
 * two-instruction pair. Everything else is shifted by it.
 *
 * The whole function is derived: the four sequential 16-slot passes, the
 * duplicated inner retry loop (`for (k = 0; k < 4; k++)` with a `break` on
 * sub_0801B018 succeeding), the guards, and the statement order inside each
 * body. gUnknown_0808EF5C is agbcc''s -fforce-addr slot holding &gUnknown_0200CC2C
 * and is spelled honestly (the `.rodata` reloc against it is the CORRECT
 * output, per the brief); promotion will need "rodata": ["0x0808EF5C"].
 * gUnknown_0200CC58 in asm/ is gUnknown_0200CC38.unk20 and gUnknown_02002FFF is
 * gUnknown_02002000[0xfff] -- neither is a global and neither is declared.
 *
 * THE MISSING FOUR BYTES. In the `else` arm of the sub_0801B120(0xff) test the
 * ROM writes
 *
 *     movs r6,#0x10 / movs r4,#8 / movs r3,#0 / movs r5,#0xf   <- preheader
 *     ...
 *     adds r0,r1,#0 / orrs r0,r4 / orrs r0,r3 / movs r1,#0xef / ands r0,r1
 *
 * i.e. `unk20[i] = (unk20[i] | 8 | v) & 0xef` with a THIRD OR operand that is a
 * register holding ZERO, hoisted into the preheader alongside the literals.
 * sub_0801A7D8 has the same idiom with `& 0xfb`, so it is a real source
 * construct, used twice, and not noise.
 *
 * SIX SPELLINGS PROBED, ALL REFUTED -- do not repeat them. `u8 v = 0` just
 * before the loop; `v = 0` before an intervening `bl`; `v` assigned 0 in both
 * arms of an `if`; `v` assigned inside a preceding loop; `v` never assigned at
 * all; `v = 0 & <global>`; and `| (v & 0x10)` / `| (v * 0x10)` with v zero. Five
 * of the eight fold the operand away entirely; the uninitialised one instead
 * hoists `v | 8` as a single register, which the ROM does NOT do -- and that
 * last observation is the useful constraint: in the ROM the two ORs are BOTH
 * inside the loop, so at reassociation time agbcc did not consider the operand
 * loop-invariant, even though the `movs #0` that defines it sits in the
 * preheader. A local whose value agbcc can see is zero cannot produce that.
 * A local zero-filled ARRAY indexed by the loop counter produces the right
 * un-reassociated shape but adds an `ldrb`.
 *
 * WAVE 65: `int v`, rather than `u8 v`, is a positive result. It restores the
 * missing `movs #0` / `orrs` pair, takes the candidate from -4 / 34.53% to
 * exact-size / 64.57%, and changes the later loops' allocation. The old claim
 * that every zero local folds was therefore too broad: the declared MODE of a
 * zero local can survive into the OR even when its value is known. The active
 * draft keeps `int`; the remaining residual is allocation/block layout in the
 * duplicated retry loops, not the missing flag operation.
 *
 * The rest of the diff is the knock-on: the flag loop stays ascending-with-index
 * instead of being reversed to a descending counter with a walking pointer, and
 * in the two big passes the PRE hoist picks &unk10[i] where the ROM picks
 * &unk00[i]. Both are register-pressure effects of the one missing live value,
 * so fix the OR operand first and re-measure before touching anything else. */
