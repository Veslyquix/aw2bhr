### Best so far

WAVE 79 (W79-C) MEASURED THE DRAFT: 120 bytes against 124 (-4), 23.4% identical, first difference at +0xc. The 78.2% this entry used to quote is best.c-s. best.c is permuter output carrying the signature sub_0803A2BC(unsigned long long a1, ...) and header-expanded prototypes: size-exact at 124 but not promotable and not a draft. The honest hand draft is the -4 one.

### What still differs

ONE INSTRUCTION in the argument head, plus 2 bytes of literal-pool padding. The ROM head is SEVEN instructions: adds r6,r1,#0 (a2 copied out of r1 FIRST, before a1 is touched at all), lsls r0,r0,#24, lsrs r1,r0,#24 ((u8)a1 into a scratch), adds r4,r1,#0, adds r4,#8, adds r0,r4,#0, lsrs r4,r0,#3. Every candidate emits SIX: adds r4,r0,#0, adds r7,r1,#0, lsls r4,r4,#24, lsrs r4,r4,#24, adds r4,#8, lsrs r4,r4,#3 -- doing the +8 and the >>3 IN PLACE on the parameter-s own promoted pseudo. The ROM has THREE pseudos where the candidate has one: (u8)a1 dies immediately into a call-clobbered r1, a1+8 dies immediately, and only the >>3 result lives across the two calls in r4. Because the candidate-s single pseudo takes r4 at once it never needs r1 freed, so a2 is copied SECOND (into r7) and the 0x8000 constant takes r6 -- the ROM has a2 in r6 and 0x8000 in r7, which is why every later register name is one off. Everything from the first pool load onward is instruction-exact.

### Why it is close

Not assessed. The high percentage is POSITIONAL and says only that the allocation diverges late; per the wave-58 ordering rule it is not evidence that little is left.

### Already ruled out

- SUPERSEDED. -Nothing was ruled out- was true of THIS ENTRY only, never of the function: waves 35 (W35-E) and 43 (W43-I) both worked it and their evidence sat in work/sub_0803A2BC/sub_0803A2BC.c the whole time. Waves 35/43 ruled out: u32 i; i = a1 + 8; i >> 3; three locals u8 v / u32 w / int i; those three declared in reverse order; int a1 with the cast at the use; and about 140k permuter iterations over three runs (63.7 -> 74.2 -> 78.2, then flat).
- Wave 79 (W79-C), NINE MORE SPELLINGS by compile_probe, every one byte-identical to the draft-s six-instruction head: y = a1; y += 8; y >>= 3 (in place, so the single-set nonzero_bits rule does not apply); y = a1 + 8u then i = y >> 3; y = a1 + 8u with y >> 3 written inline at both calls; u8 c / u32 y / u32 i as three single-assignment locals; i = (a1 + 8u) >> 3 bound once; the asymmetric best.c shape written honestly (y = a1 + 8u used by one call, (a1 + 8u) >> 3 inline at the other); u8 v = a2->unk00 hoisted; a struct Unk08499594 *p = a2 alias; and u32 a1 with ((u8)a1 + 8u) >> 3. Only the a2 hoist changed anything, and it moved the ldrb EARLIER rather than moving the copy, which is the wrong direction.
- Wave 79 (W79-C) CLASSIFICATION: a COPY-COALESCING decision with no source handle. No C spelling makes agbcc keep (u8)a1 and a1+8 as separate short-lived pseudos, because every spelling of a single-use chain lets local_alloc coalesce them into the parameter-s pseudo; and lsrs rD,rS,#imm5 is a 3-operand form, so the ROM-s adds r0,r4,#0 before the shift is a non-coalesced copy that no correct allocation would emit and no expression tree requests. Under the wave-77 screen this is -register numbers with nothing behind them-. Do not spend another wave-s budget on the head.

### Notes

Wave 79 (W79-C) -- THIS IS NOW AN INVESTIGATED PARK; the position-only wave-59 text is replaced. THE HARNESS QUESTION THE OLD NOTE ASKED IS ANSWERED: W79-C surveyed all 155 entries and this was the ONLY never-investigated one. 66 entries are bare strings and 7 dict entries carry an empty axes_ruled_out, but every one of those still records a measured score and a named wave, so they are investigated parks that merely lack the structured field. The -uninvestigated entry hides an unworked function- failure is therefore a ONE-OFF, not a class -- but it still cost this function twenty waves of invisibility, and the fix is the one the old note proposed: a position-only entry must never be written into parked.json at all, because parked.json is the exclusion list every pre-flight reads. Note for the record that the named exemplar src/decomp/c_0803A338.c is the matched CALLER (sub_0803A2BC(gUnknown_0849D89C->unk00, gUnknown_0849D89C->unk04)); it confirms the parameter types and nothing else, and cannot address an allocation residual -- exactly what the wave-57 rule about named exemplars predicts.

### Wave 87

WAVE 87 (W87-C, unnamed-twin axis): twins sub_080059FC / sub_08005AA0 (src/decomp/c_080059FC.c, shared callee sub_08014A5C + gUnknown_08499578) LACK the construct -- all eleven of their sub_08014A5C calls pass integer LITERALS in argument 1, both are `void f(void)`, no computed argument anywhere. Prototype check also negative: include/unknown-functions.h:6450 `void sub_08014A5C(int, int, void *, int, int, int)` (all six wide, read off the callee's prologue) agrees with the promoted callers, so `(a1 + 8u) >> 3` is passed with no narrowing and there is no argument-narrowing lever. Clean NO, 0 probes, 0 try_match. DO NOT batch this on the shared callee again: the sub_08014A5C / gUnknown_08499578 vocabulary is a UI-drawing hub shared by dozens of literal-argument functions and carries no information about the head residual. Configured, 120/124 (-4), 23.4%, unchanged.
