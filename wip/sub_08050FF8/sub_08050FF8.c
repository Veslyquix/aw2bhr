/* WAVE 85 (W85-C).  CORRECTION to the wave-37 note, found by reading the full

 * ROM reaches each of them with a DOUBLE load -- `ldr r4,=gUnknown_081360E0 ;
 * ldr r2,[r4] ; ... adds r0,r0,r2 ; ldrh r0,[r0,#4]` -- and uses the loaded
 * value as a BASE, which a force-addr word never is.  They are four const
 * pointer objects (declared in include/unknown-globals.h next to the
 * gUnknown_081360A0/A4/A8 cells), and the code chases them:
 *   - gUnknown_081360E4 (holds 0x03004580) is the row-pointer spelling of
 *     gUnknown_03004580: EVERY 03004580 access in the ROM goes through it
 *     (there is no `=gUnknown_03004580` pool word anywhere in the function),
 *     with the column offset folded onto the chased value (+2 for [1], +4 for
 *     [2]).
 *   - gUnknown_081360D8 (holds 0x020298E0) serves ONLY the three .unk8c
 *     accesses (0xD arm, else arm, increment); the .unk16/.unk00/.unk18
 *     accesses keep the direct `=gUnknown_020298E0` spelling.
 *   - gUnknown_081360E0 (holds 0x085D6A48) serves ONLY the `unk04 == 0` test;
 *     the x-sum's .unk08 read keeps the direct `=gUnknown_085D6A48` word.
 *   - gUnknown_081360DC (holds 0x0300453C) takes over from the direct spelling
 *     at the `03004580[side^1][2] == 1` test: every side read from there to
 *     the end of the function is `*gUnknown_081360DC` (the ROM reassigns r8
 *     from &0300453C to &081360DC at exactly that point), while the six reads
 *     before it stay direct.

/* WAVE 88 (W88-B).  THIS DRAFT HAD NOT COMPILED SINCE WAVE 86 AND NOBODY HAD
 * NOTICED -- three waves of "parked at 21.5%" was a score for source that no
 * oracle could build.  Wave 86 (W86-C) retyped gUnknown_085643A8 from
 * `struct Unk085643A8 { const s16 unk00[2]; const s16 unk04[2]; }` to
 * `extern const s16 gUnknown_085643A8[][2]` in include/unknown-globals.h,
 * which turned this file's `gUnknown_085643A8.unk04[m]` into
 * "request for member `unk04' in something not a structure or union".
 *
 * Fixed here to the array spelling W86-C proved is the ROM's form:
 * `.unk04[m]` -> `[1][m]` (member offset 4 == row 1 of s16[2]), and the
 * redundant `(const s16 (*)[2])&gUnknown_085643A8` cast in the else arm
 * dropped now that the declared type is already `const s16 [][2]`.
 *
 * LESSON FOR THE ORCHESTRATOR, worth more than the score: a header retype in
 * one agent's batch can silently break an unrelated open draft, and NOTHING in
 * the pipeline catches it -- per-function `trymatch` is only run on the
 * functions a wave batches, and a park entry records the last score, not the
 * last build. A cheap sweep that just COMPILES every open draft after each
 * wave's header edits would have caught this in wave 86. */

/* WAVE 88 (W88-C).  W88-B's residual 1 ("the candidate chases one pointer level
 * too many") and residual 2 ("two .rodata force-addr words the ROM lacks") ARE
 * ONE FACT, and it is fixed. They were never two bugs: the extra `ldr` at each
 * site IS the load through the force-addr word.
 *
 * MECHANISM (measured, and it generalises -- see the doc chapter). A BARE
 * reference to a `T *const` pointer OBJECT read from more than one basic block
 * makes agbcc park the OBJECT'S OWN ADDRESS in a `.rodata` address constant and
 * reach it with an extra indirection:
 *     candidate   .LC8: .word gUnknown_081360E4      (in .rodata)
 *                 .text pool holds `.word .LC8`, every use is
 *                 `mov r1,r9 / ldr r0,[r1] / ldr r1,[r0]`     -- THREE insns
 *     ROM         .text pool holds `.word gUnknown_081360E4`, every use is
 *                 `mov r1,sl / ldr r2,[r1]`                   -- TWO insns
 * The candidate emitted FOUR such words (gUnknown_0300451C, _081360E4,
 * _081360DC, _081360D8), not the two W88-B counted.
 *
 * FIX: the old `c_local` workaround applied to the POINTER OBJECT ITSELF --
 * bind the object's ADDRESS to a local and read through it:
 *     u16 (*const *pE4)[8] = &gUnknown_081360E4;   ... (*pE4)[i][j]
 * The address then reaches the allocator as an ordinary source pseudo, agbcc
 * materialises it once with a plain `ldr rN,=sym` pool word and re-loads the
 * VALUE at each use -- exactly the ROM. Applied to all four, ALL FOUR .rodata
 * words disappear and the .text pool becomes the ROM's. gUnknown_081360E0 is
 * referenced ONCE and never needed it: the trigger is multi-block reference
 * count, not the type.
 *
 * SECOND FIX, same wave: THE ROM BINDS E4's COLUMN BASES. Where the candidate
 * folded the column offset into the load displacement (`ldrh r1,[r0,#0x2]`),
 * the ROM forms it as its own runtime add off the chased value -- `adds r0,#2`
 * for column 1 and, decisively, `adds r7,r2,#4` for column 2 KEPT IN r7 AND
 * REUSED AT TWO SITES. A reused column base in a callee-saved register cannot
 * come from a displacement. The two-statement address form reproduces it:
 *     e4 = *pE4;  c2 = (u16 *)e4 + 2;  ... c2[idx * 8] ...
 * which emits `add r6,r2,#4 / lsl r1,r0,#4 / add r0,r1,r6 / ldrh r4,[r0]`,
 * byte-for-byte the ROM. Same lever as sub_0803CFA4's `+2` this wave: a
 * constant offset that the store/load insn can absorb is folded below the tree
 * level, so NO spelling of a single expression reaches it -- only splitting the
 * address across two statements does.
 *
 * STILL OPEN, and both are named source constructs, not ties:
 *   - THE X-SUM's COLUMN 1 IS STILL A DISPLACEMENT. `((u16 *)*pE4 + 1)[i]`
 *     inline does NOT split (fold collapses it back); it needs its own two
 *     statements, like the if-block. MEASURED: adding `dc = *pDC; e4 = *pE4;
 *     cp = (u16 *)e4 + 1;` before the x-sum DOES produce the ROM's
 *     `add r7,r1,#0x2` there AND fixes the tail (the ROM keeps the chased
 *     `*pDC` POINTER in r7 and re-reads `ldrh r1,[r7]`, which `dc = *pDC;`
 *     reproduces) -- but in that configuration agbcc force-addrs
 *     gUnknown_020298E0 instead (a new `.LC2`), because freeing a register
 *     changes which symbol crosses the multi-block threshold. The two fixes
 *     are in tension through register pressure; that tension is the next
 *     wave's target, not a tie.
 *   - The constant 1 lands in a hi register (`mov r2,#1 / mov sl,r2 /
 *     mov r2,sl`) where the ROM has `movs r6,#1 / eors r0,r6` -- two extra
 *     instructions, downstream of the same pressure. */

/* WAVE 89 (W89-A).  ALL SCORES UNDER THE `configured` PROFILE.  Snapshot of
 * W88-C's fixpoint in work/sub_08050FF8/w89-start.c.
 *
 * THE PROMPT'S PRE-REGISTERED HYPOTHESIS WAS REFUTED, AND THE REFUTATION IS
 * THE USEFUL RESULT.  Wave 89 was told: the ROM re-loads gUnknown_03001FBC's
 * address from the pool at four sites where the candidate caches it in r8, and
 * the `static inline` re-read lever (wave 88) should force the re-derivation.
 * Both halves are wrong.
 *
 * 1. THE CANDIDATE'S PER-SITE INSTRUCTION COUNT WAS ALREADY THE ROM'S. At
 *    every gUnknown_03001FBC site after the first, the ROM emits
 *    `ldr r2,=sym / movs r0,#0 / ldrsh r1,[r2,r0]` and the candidate emits
 *    `mov r0,r8 / mov r2,#0 / ldrsh r1,[r0,r2]`. Three THUMB insns either way,
 *    two bytes each. The r8 cache costs ONE instruction in total -- the
 *    `mov r8,r0` in the prologue -- and NOT one per site. The whole "four
 *    re-loads vs a cached pointer" reading of this residual counts a
 *    difference of REGISTER NAME as a difference of SIZE.
 *
 * 2. THE `static inline` LEVER MAKES IT WORSE, NOT BETTER (measured, one
 *    probe). `static __inline__ __typeof__(gUnknown_03001FBC) fbc(void)
 *    { return gUnknown_03001FBC; }` called at all seven sites DOES delete the
 *    `mov r8,r0`, giving a prologue with the ROM's exact instruction count --
 *    and then cse merges the SCALED INDEX across the unk2c/unk30/unk34 stores,
 *    which the ROM recomputes at each one. Net about FIFTEEN instructions
 *    SHORT on a candidate that was already short. The wave-88 chapter's
 *    reachable set is "re-read a pool word AFTER A CALL"; sites 2-5 here have
 *    no call between them, so the lever never applied.
 *
 * 3. A VOLATILE READ (`#define FBC (*(volatile s16 *)&gUnknown_03001FBC)`)
 *    DOES reproduce the ROM's per-site re-derivation of the value and of all
 *    the arithmetic derived from it -- ten insns per store, exactly the ROM's
 *    ten -- but it emits `ldrh / lsl #16 / asr #16` where the ROM has
 *    `movs #0 / ldrsh`, because combine will not fold a volatile MEM into a
 *    sign_extend. Byte-neutral against the plain draft at those sites and a
 *    strict loss in the prologue. NOT the answer, and recorded here so nobody
 *    re-runs it.
 *
 * WHAT THE ROM'S RE-LOADS ACTUALLY MEAN -- READ THE ADDRESS AND THE VALUE
 * SEPARATELY. At the unk2c/unk30 pair the ROM loads `ldr r2,=sym` ONCE and
 * reuses r2 across BOTH stores while re-loading the value and recomputing
 * `v*3*32` at each. So cse DOES share the address there; the later "re-loads"
 * are reload rematerialising a `ldr rN,=sym` whose pseudo LOST its hard
 * register. That is the wave-17 diagnostic read backwards: the ROM holds the
 * address in a dying scratch because it has MORE live values than the
 * candidate, not because the source respells the reference. The prologue
 * `mov r8,r0` is therefore the LAST symptom of the -16 bytes, exactly as the
 * brief's "a prologue difference is the last symptom to appear and the first
 * one you see" says. DO NOT SPEND ANOTHER WAVE ON gUnknown_03001FBC's
 * SPELLING; spend it on the missing instructions.
 *
 * WHAT MOVED: W88-C's own two-statement address split, applied to the TWO
 * COLUMN-1 SITES IT LEFT. W88-C fixed column 2 (`c2 = (u16 *)e4 + 2`) and
 * wrote that the x-sum's column 1 "needs its own two statements" but banked
 * neither that nor the `unk04 == 0` test's. Both are done here:
 *     e4  = *pE4;  c1  = (u16 *)e4 + 1;   before the `unk04 == 0` test
 *     e4b = *pE4;  c1b = (u16 *)e4b + 1;  before the x-sum
 * Each emits the ROM's `adds r1,#2` as its own instruction where the draft had
 * folded it into `ldrh r1,[r0,#0x2]`. SEPARATE LOCALS FOR THE X-SUM ARE
 * DELIBERATE: the ROM re-chases *pE4 and re-adds #2 there rather than reusing
 * the if-block's value, and reusing one local across both would make one pseudo
 * with a live range spanning the calls (the wave-17 punctuation rule).
 *
 * REMAINING, in the order they are worth attacking:
 *   - THE `+2` AND THE INDEX SHIFT ARE EMITTED IN THE OPPOSITE ORDER TO THE
 *     ROM at both new sites (ROM `lsls r0,r5,#4` then `adds r1,#2`; candidate
 *     `add r1,r1,#0x2` then `lsl r0,r3,#0x4`). Same instructions, same bytes,
 *     wrong order -- so the ROM reads the SIDE before it forms the column
 *     base. Binding the side to its own local ahead of the column bind is the
 *     next thing to try. This is the identical residual sub_0803CFA4 carries.
 *   - THE ROM SETS UP sb=&_081360D8, r8=&_081360DC AND sl=&_081360E4 INSIDE
 *     the `unk04 == 0` block (four insns) where the candidate defers D8/DC to
 *     the following block (three insns). Move `pDC`/`pD8`'s binds above the
 *     `unk04 == 0` test to match.
 *   - THREE DISTINCT CONSTANT 1s. The ROM materialises `movs r5,#1` and
 *     `movs r7,#1` in the first block and a THIRD, `movs r6,#1`, at
 *     _080511A6, reusing r6 for both `^1`s in the if-block. The candidate
 *     merges the late one with the early one and pays `mov r2,#1 / mov r8,r2 /
 *     mov r3,r8` for it. This is wave-80's "same register, different block =
 *     one variable" read in reverse: THREE registers in three blocks = three
 *     source constants.
 *
 * AND THE 8 BYTES: THE POINTER-OBJECT BINDS BELONG INSIDE THE `unk04 == 0`
 * BLOCK. The ROM sets up sb=&_081360D8, r8=&_081360DC and sl=&_081360E4 after
 * the test expression is computed but BEFORE the conditional branch; the draft
 * bound pDC/pD8 after the if/else MERGE. No statement position exists between
 * an `if`'s condition and its branch -- so make one, by binding the test's
 * value to its own local:
 *     t = ((struct Unk85D6A48Row *)gUnknown_081360E0)[c1[side * 8]].unk04;
 *     pDC = &gUnknown_081360DC;
 *     pD8 = &gUnknown_081360D8;
 *     if (t == 0) ...
 * -16 BYTES -> -8 BYTES, 12.2% -> 14.8%, IN ONE EDIT. First movement on this
 * function since wave 37. See the doc chapter.
 *
 * MEASURED PROGRESSION, all `configured`:
 *     W88-C fixpoint (w89-start.c)      788  -16   11.9%
 *     + the two column-1 splits          788  -16   12.2%
 *     + the bind ordering (w89a-final.c) 796   -8   14.8%
 *
 * IGNORE `best.json` ON THIS FUNCTION. It reads 21.52% and `best.c` is the
 * 2,687-byte wave-37 file that HAS NOT COMPILED SINCE WAVE 86 (W88-B found the
 * header retype that broke it). That percentage describes source no oracle can
 * build. The draft's real score is the one in the table above.
 *
 * THE REMAINING RESIDUAL IS ONE ALLOCATION FACT, NOW FULLY NAMED. The ROM
 * keeps &gUnknown_0300453C in the HI register r8 and pays `mov rLow,r8` at
 * every one of its six reads, and keeps &gUnknown_020298E0 in r9 the same way;
 * the candidate keeps both in LOW registers and reads them directly, one
 * instruction shorter per read. That is the SAME FACT as the prologue's
 * `mov r8,r0`: in the ROM &gUnknown_03001FBC LOSES the callee-saved register
 * to &gUnknown_0300453C and is rematerialised, while in the candidate it WINS
 * r8. By the wave-17 tie-break (equal reference counts, first-created pseudo
 * wins) the candidate is behaving CORRECTLY -- both are read six times and
 * gUnknown_03001FBC is read first, in sub_0801566C's argument. The ROM inverts
 * the tie. The question for wave 90 is what gives gUnknown_0300453C the
 * heavier allocno -- NOT how to respell gUnknown_03001FBC, whose three
 * candidate levers are all measured and refuted above.

 *   - a BIND statement (`c1 = (u16 *)e4 + 1;`) always emits `adds #2` BEFORE
 *     the index shift -- and binding the SIDE first (W89-A's proposal) moves
 *     the side's LOAD up but leaves the shift after the `adds #2`; binding the
 *     ELEMENT index (`idx = side * 8`) is byte-identical to it, because combine
 *     folds the bind's *8 with the subscript's *2 at the use and the bind emits
 *     nothing at all.
 *   - ANY inline form of the `+1` -- 2-D subscript `e4[side][1]`,
 *     constant-in-index `b[side*8+1]`, index-first sum

 *     `ldrh [r0,#0x2]`. (W88's addressing-mode bound, on four more tree forms.)
 * The two instructions come from two different phases: `adds #2` is the bind
 * STATEMENT's expansion, pinned to that statement; the shift is the REFERENCE's

 *     c1  = (u16 *)e4 + 1;
 *     ... *(u16 *)((u8 *)c1 + off) ...
 * Emits the ROM's order exactly: ldr / ldrh / lsls #4 / adds #2 / adds / ldrh
 * with no displacement. Applied at BOTH column-1 sites. Residue at the site is
 * only `adds r0,r0,r1` vs `adds r0,r1,r0` -- W80-D's commutative operand order,
 * a different axis. Chapter in docs/agbcc-codegen.md.
 *
 * REFUTED: THE PROMPT'S "THE ROM INVERTS THE WAVE-17 TIE" FRAMING. The ROM does
 * not invert a tie; it never enters &gUnknown_03001FBC into the competition.
 * Read the ROM's own prologue: `ldr r1,[pc,#336]` puts &gUnknown_03001FBC in a
 * LOW SCRATCH that DIES at the `bl sub_0801566C`, and only AFTER the call are
 * &gUnknown_020298E0 and &gUnknown_0300453C materialised into r9 and r8. There
 * is no pair of equally-ranked call-crossing allocnos competing for one
 * register. The candidate's prologue `mov r8,r0` exists because ITS
 * &gUnknown_03001FBC is one pseudo shared ACROSS the call; the ROM's is not.
 *
 * SO THE QUESTION FOR WAVE 90, RESTATED: what makes the address used at
 * `sub_0801566C(gUnknown_03001FBC, &oam)` fail to reach the four
 * `gUnknown_03001470[gUnknown_03001FBC]` stores after the call? That is a
 * cse/gcse unification across a `bl`, not an allocation tie -- and by W89-C's
 * own partition it is the ONE splitter class with a live lever (`static inline`
 * splits a memory bind, and a `bl` kills memory), not the dead one.
 *
 * WHICH ALSO EXPLAINS W89-A'S static-inline LOSS: it applied the helper at ALL
 * SEVEN sites, deleting the very pre-call reference that must stay bare (W89-C's
 * "leave at least one bare reference" trap), after which cse merged the scaled
 * index across the unk2c/unk30/unk34 stores. THE UNTESTED SPELLING IS THE
 * HELPER AT THE POST-CALL SITES ONLY, line 44's reference left bare. One
 * try_match; I ran out of budget before it.
 *
 * NOT RE-RUN (W89-A measured these; do not repeat): static inline at all seven
 * sites; the volatile read (loses the `ldrsh` -- combine will not fold a
 * volatile MEM into a sign_extend); the "four re-loads vs a cached pointer"
 * reading (the r8 cache costs ONE instruction in the whole function).
 *
 * Toolchain axis not re-swept (W81-E: 155 drafts x 7 profiles, zero flips). */

 * unk2c, unk30, unk34, sub_08015608's argument, sub_08050528's argument), with
 * the pre-call sub_0801566C(gUnknown_03001FBC, &oam) reference left BARE
 * exactly as W89-C's "leave at least one bare reference" trap requires:
 *
 *     W89-E fixpoint (w89g-start.c)   796  -8   15.4%  672/796 differ
 *     + helper at post-call sites     764  -40  10.2%  682/764 differ
 *
 * A 32-BYTE REGRESSION -- the same size W89-A measured for the all-seven-sites
 * spelling. Draft restored and re-verified at 796 / -8 / 15.4%.
 *
 * LEAVING THE PRE-CALL REFERENCE BARE DOES NOT RESCUE THE HELPER. W89-C's
 * bare-reference trap is about the -fforce-addr .rodata word mechanism; it is
 * not what costs the bytes here. The three adjacent gUnknown_03001470[...]
 * stores are ALL post-call, so they route through the helper together whether
 * or not a seventh reference stays bare, and cse merges across them regardless.
 *
 * THE RE-FRAMING, WORTH MORE THAN THE PROBE. W89-A and W89-E both treated the
 * ADDRESS of gUnknown_03001FBC as the object of this residual. Measured twice
 * now (all seven sites, and post-call only), THE ADDRESS IS NOT WHERE THE BYTES
 * ARE: every spelling that makes the address re-derive at each use also lets
 * cse merge the derived SCALED INDEX across the unk2c/unk30/unk34 stores, and
 * the candidate comes out 30-40 bytes SHORTER rather than closer. The ~15
 * missing instructions are THE SCALED-INDEX RECOMPUTATIONS AT THOSE THREE
 * STORES -- a cse VALUE unification of three identical computations, not an
 * address unification, not a gcse-across-a-bl fact, and not an allocation tie.
 * W89-E's reading of the ROM prologue stands (the pre-call address genuinely
 * dies at the bl); the inference that the helper reaches this residual does not.
 *
 * PRE-REGISTERED FOR WAVE 90, never run here: W87's REDUNDANT-MASK LEVER
 * (((v << 22 & 0xffc00000) >> 22)) APPLIED TO THE INDEX at the three stores. By
 * W89-C's partition the splitter for a VALUE cse is volatile, and W89-A's
 * volatile probe put the volatile on the FBC READ (which loses the ldrsh --
 * combine will not fold a volatile MEM into a sign_extend); that is a
 * measurement about the read, not the index. The mask lever attacks cse's value
 * numbering directly and combine deletes the AND, so it costs nothing.
 *
 * DO NOT SPEND WAVE 90 ON gUnknown_03001FBC'S ADDRESS AGAIN. Four levers
 * against it are now measured and refuted: static inline at all seven sites
 * (W89-A), static inline at the post-call sites only (W89-G), the volatile read
 * (W89-A), and the bare reference (W88-C). Toolchain axis not re-swept
 * (W81-E: 155 drafts x 7 profiles, zero exit-0 flips). */

/* WAVE 89 (W89-I). ALL SCORES UNDER THE `configured` PROFILE, re-measured, not
 * inherited: 796 bytes against 804 (-8), 15.4%, 672 of 796 differ, first
 * difference at +0xc. Every W89-E / W89-G figure reproduces. Snapshot in
 * work/sub_08050FF8/w89i-start.c. THIS BODY IS UNCHANGED BY ME -- no try_match
 * spent, because the probe below removed the reason to spend one.
 *
 * REFUTED: THE FIFTH SPLITTER (W89-D's fold-proof mask) AT THE THREE STORES.
 * Both halves of the pre-registered hypothesis are false.
 *
 *  1. THERE IS NO SHARED INDEX TO SPLIT. This draft ALREADY recomputes the
 *     scaled index at unk2c, unk30 and unk34 -- each store emits its own
 *     `mov rN,r8 / movs rM,#0 / ldrsh / lsls #1 / adds / lsls #5`, which is the
 *     ROM's sequence instruction for instruction (the ROM differs only in
 *     reaching &gUnknown_03001FBC by a pool `ldr` and in holding
 *     &gUnknown_03001470 in `sl` where this body uses `ip`). The intervening
 *     `str` kills the memory value, so cse cannot merge them. W89-G's "the ~15
 *     missing instructions are the scaled-index recomputations" was a
 *     measurement of the STATIC INLINE drafts -- there the read becomes a
 *     register value with no memory dependence, which is exactly why every
 *     helper spelling came out 30-40 bytes SHORT. Counted from the diff's hunk
 *     headers this candidate is short by 2/1/1/2 lines in four hunks and EQUAL
 *     in the last four: six lines, not fifteen.
 *  2. A FOLD-PROOF MASK ON A MEMORY-LOADED VALUE IS ABSORBED BY THE LOAD.
 *     One compile_probe, an 8-bit fold-proof mask on the unk30 index and a
 *     16-bit one on unk34: the AND neither survives to cse nor dies in combine
 *     -- combine folds it INTO the load, giving `ldrb r1,[r3]` and
 *     `ldrh r1,[r3]` in place of `movs r2,#0 / ldrsh r1,[r0,r2]`. One
 *     instruction SHORTER per site, wrong load width, on a body already 8 bytes
 *     short. Chapter appended to docs/agbcc-codegen.md bounding W89-D: the mask
 *     reaches a REGISTER value whose nonzero_bits already fit it, never a bare
 *     narrow-global read.
 *
 * WHAT THE RESIDUAL IS, read off the diff rather than inferred. This candidate
 * holds FOUR addresses in long-lived registers (r5=&gUnknown_0300453C,
 * r8=&gUnknown_03001FBC, r9=&gUnknown_020298E0, ip=&gUnknown_03001470); THE ROM
 * HOLDS THREE (r8=&gUnknown_0300453C, r9=&gUnknown_020298E0,
 * sl=&gUnknown_03001470) and rematerialises &gUnknown_03001FBC from the pool at
 * each group of uses. Holding one fewer address pushes the ROM's
 * &gUnknown_0300453C out of the low callee-saved bank into r8, where it pays a
 * `mov rLow,r8` at each of its ~6 reads; this body reads `ldrh rN,[r5]`
 * directly. That is where the ~5 instructions are, and it is ONE fact.
 * Read forwards: THE ROM BINDS THE SIDE VALUE WHERE THIS BODY BINDS THE SIDE
 * ADDRESS.
 *
 * FIVE LEVERS ARE NOW MEASURED AND REFUTED AGAINST gUnknown_03001FBC's
 * SPELLING -- do not re-run any of them: the `static inline` helper at all seven
 * sites (-15 insns); the helper at the six post-call sites with the pre-call
 * reference bare (764 bytes, -40, 10.2%); the `volatile` read (loses the
 * `ldrsh`; combine will not fold a volatile MEM into a sign_extend); the "four
 * re-loads versus a cached pointer" reading (the r8 cache costs ONE instruction
 * in the whole function); and the fold-proof mask (above). Every lever that
 * removes the hold also removes the memory dependence that keeps the three
 * store indices apart. THE NEXT LEVER MUST REMOVE THE HOLD WHILE LEAVING THE
 * REFERENCE A BARE MEMORY READ -- or, more promisingly, must attack the LOW
 * bank instead of the hold, giving r4-r7 a fifth competing value so that
 * &gUnknown_0300453C is forced into a hi register as it is in the ROM.
 *
 * Toolchain axis not re-swept (W81-E: 155 drafts x 7 profiles, zero exit-0
 * flips). `best so far: 21.5%` remains the wave-37 fossil; ignore it. */
