 * sub_0805D648(x, y, 10, 0, 0) from inside ONE loop body with plain int
 * counters and ACCEPTS the strength_reduce giv -- its header says so outright
 * ("The `x << 16` in r8 is strength_reduce's giv ... it is not authored").
 * It has no exit block and no second call outside the loop, so it contains
 * nothing that keeps a conversion out of cse's reach -- which is the one
 * construct this park still needs. See work/sub_0805D888/W86-notes.md. */

/* Wave 80 (W80-E): parked with a full mechanisation -- see the new
 * data/parked.json entry.  Headline: the asm barrier below is MASKING A
 * CORRECT LAYOUT.  Barrier-free with sub_0804236C(x, y) direct, the compiler
 * reproduces the ROM's whole frame (bestX spilled to sp+4, bestY sp+8, flag
 * sp+12, e sp+16) and even the ROM's odd y-guard (`ldr r3,[sp,#8]; cmp`,
 * bestY's slot standing in for the constant 0); the ONLY residual is the two
 * strength-reduced givs (x<<16 -> sl, y<<16 -> stack), which exist because the
 * found: block's (s16) conversions CSE-merge with the body call's (the
 * post-call `mov ip, sl` copies are loop.c's not-replaceable moves).  Four
 * spellings probed this wave all still merge (fx/fy at label, copies at the
 * goto site, inline found block, s16 copies at the body call).  The open
 * question is narrowed to: what source form keeps the exit conversion out of
 * cse's reach while reading raw x/y. */

/* Wave 77 (W77-C): SIZE-EXACT AT LAST -- 508/508, 45.3% -> 52.2%, and the
 * lever was one line. The `found:` exit block was reusing the loop body's `sx`
 * and `sy`; CSE merged the two `(s16)` conversions into one pseudo spanning the
 * function, which is what made loop.c's worth-while test keep the givs. Giving
 * the exit block its OWN `fx`/`fy` removes 36 bytes on its own. Chapter added
 * to docs/agbcc-codegen.md (wave 54's fresh-name-per-site rule, applied across
 * a control-flow edge).
 *
 * STILL OPEN, and the barrier below is still doing real work: without it the
 * body's own conversions become givs again -- `sub_0804236C(x, y)` spelled
 * directly is 544 (+36), `sx = x; sy = y;` with no barrier is also 544, and
 * barrier on `sx` alone is 532 (+24). The two `adds rN, rM, #0` copies the
 * barrier emits are not in the ROM.
 *
 * REMAINING DIFF, now that the size is right: the ROM's frame is 20 and this
 * draft's is 16. The ROM spills `bestX` to sp+4 (the other three zero-inits
 * shift to sp+8/12/16) and spends sl on the hoisted 0x1f mask; this draft keeps
 * `bestX` in sl and reloads 31 at each site. One more value that must live in a
 * callee-saved register is what is missing. NOTE the permuter CANNOT be run on
 * this draft -- `permute.py` fails to parse the `asm(...)` barrier ("Syntax
 * error in base.c"), so any allocation search here needs the barrier replaced
 * first. */
/* Wave 76 advance: separate int copies plus empty-asm barriers at the two
 * s16 call sites prevent CSE from sharing the conversions across the loop.
 * This removes both unwanted strength-reduced givs and improves the configured
 * result from 544 bytes / 33.1% to 512 bytes / 45.3%. The remaining +4-byte
 * residual is allocation/pressure: the candidate has a 16-byte frame and
 * keeps bestX in sl, while the ROM has a 20-byte frame, spills bestX, and uses
 * sl for the hoisted 0x1f mask. Explicit fixed mask/row-offset registers were
 * tested and regress to 544 bytes, so they do not reproduce that pressure.
 *
 * PARKED at 508 bytes expected / 544 emitted (+36) on Wave 62's current
 * configured remeasurement. The old 536-byte Wave 49 measurement below is
 * stale. `old-agbcc` is also 544 and does not change the strength-reduction
 * mechanism; `old-agbcc-no-force` worsens to 556. `o1` suppresses the excess
 * givs and reaches 504 (-4), but diverges from +0xa and is not a viable
 * override. Giving the body call separate s16 copies increases configured to
 * 552 (+44), so it does not split the shared conversions and is ruled out.
 *
 * Historical Wave 49 note (extension work
 * after the assigned batch closed 4/4).
 *
 * THE SHAPE IS RIGHT AND THE WHOLE RESIDUAL IS ONE THING: agbcc strength-
 * reduces `x << 16` and `y << 16` into two induction variables that the ROM
 * does not have. Everything else is byte-exact -- the prologue, the
 * sub_0805C290 / sub_0805E5AC / sub_0804236C head, both sub_0805D648 call
 * shapes, all three scoring arms cross-jumped into one update block, the
 * `flag`/0x11 early exit, and the tail.
 *
 * The two givs cost 7 extra instructions (their increments at both loop
 * bottoms, plus `mov ip,sl` / `mov r9,r3` to carry them to the exit block) and
 * they also take the two callee-saved registers the ROM spends on the hoisted
 * 0x1f mask (`mov r0,sl; ands r0,r1` in the ROM against `movs r0,#31` here) and
 * on the y*2 giv (sb in the ROM, sp+0x14 here). So the diff reads as four
 * differences and is ONE.
 *
 * Where they come from: `(s16)x` expands to `(x << 16) >> 16`, the `lsl` is
 * `mult (biv, 65536)` and loop.c records it as a giv. It survives loop.c's
 * worth-while test only because the value is live a long time -- CSE has
 * already merged the `(s16)x` at the sub_0804236C call with the `(s16)x` at the
 * `found:` block, so one pseudo spans the whole body. The ROM RECOMPUTES
 * `lsls r0,r4,#0x10; asrs r0,r0,#0x10` at the exit block from the raw counter,
 * which is what keeps each giv's lifetime at two insns and gets it rejected.
 *
 * RULED OUT by probe, so do not re-spend these:
 *   - `s16 x, y` loop counters. Then the s16 formals of sub_0804236C need no
 *     conversion at all and both shift pairs disappear, while the ROM has them;
 *     the counters' own `adds r4,#1` with no re-extension says int as well.
 *   - Writing the exit block inline (`sub_0805D648(...); return;` at the point
 *     of the test) rather than behind a `goto`. The `goto` version above is
 *     strictly better and IS worth keeping: it is what moves the exit block
 *     physically past the loop, which fixed the y/best register assignment
 *     (y -> r6, best -> r8, map pool word -> r7) and merged the three update
 *     blocks. The inline version additionally spilled a third giv and needed a
 *     0x20 frame against the ROM's 0x14; this one needs 0x1c.
 *
 * Wave 66 tested five shape/type spellings at the body call -- `(s16)(u16)x`,
 * `(s16)(u32)x`, `(s16)(x & 0xffff)`, `(s16)(x + 0u)` and `(s16)(x * 1)` (and
 * the same for y). All fold to the identical shared conversions, preserve both
 * unwanted givs and the +36-byte residual. The permuter is the wrong tool here
 * -- this is an extra-instruction residual, not an allocation one.
 *
 * Prototype work done for this function is already committed and is NOT part of
 * the park: sub_0805D648's signature was corrected to (s16, s16, u8, u8, u8) and
 * sub_0802042C's to (int, int, u8 *), both in include/unknown-functions.h with
 * the evidence. sub_0805D648 itself MATCHED. */
