# sub_080364F4

0x080364F4, 296 bytes, THUMB, parked.

Best score so far: 9.5% (best.c).

## What it does

Sets up the players for the current map from its chapter record gUnknown_085C77A0[gPlaySt.mapID] (0x5c-byte records), after calling sub_080191B0. In game modes 1 and 2 it copies, for each of the four armies, a byte from the record's offset-0x44 run, the army colour (offset 0x40) and the CO (offset 0x3c) into gPlaySt's per-army arrays, with CO 0xff meaning 'use gUnknown_030058D4's choice' for the first three armies; in mode 0 it copies only the COs. It then starts the record's pre-placed-unit script with sub_080193B0 if there is one and the map category is 2 or less, and otherwise calls sub_080364E0.

## How close it is

Compiles 16 bytes short (280 of 296 bytes); only 9.5% of bytes line up, which means little because the size difference shifts everything after it. All three branches, both four-army loops, the 0xff fallback and the final script choice are present.

## What is left

The original loads the record table's base address through a pointer word, keeps it in a register, and adds the field offsets (0x3c, 0x40, 0x44) at run time; the draft's plain array indexing lets the compiler fold those offsets into its address constants and order the bases differently. Find a spelling that keeps the base separate without the extra 4-byte stack slot the probes so far caused.

## Already tried

- Naming the original's two private pointer words (at 0x08090EBC and 0x08090EC0) and adding table/base locals: reproduces the original's extra load step but forces a 4-byte stack frame the original does not have.
- Switching directly on the u8 gameMode member: gives an unsigned comparison where the original's is signed, so the switch uses an int copy.
- Reading the offset-0x44 bytes as `unk44[i].unk00`, the shared struct's declared shape: scales the index by 4, which is wrong; they are read through a byte cast instead.

### Notes

PARKED Wave 71 at 280/296 (-16), 9.5%. Private-slot/table-base probes restore the initial indirection but force a non-ROM four-byte frame. This confirms base association/allocation rather than missing statements; shared structs and the readable semantic draft are retained.
