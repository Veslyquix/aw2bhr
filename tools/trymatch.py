"""Compile a candidate C function and decide whether it matches the original.

The verdict is byte equality of the function's encoded range, plus equality of
its relocations. Bytes alone are not enough: two objects can hold identical
instruction encodings while one calls the wrong function, because an unresolved
`bl` is the same placeholder bytes whatever symbol it points at.

The target comes from the assembled original -- build/functions/<unit>.o -- not
from the ROM, so both sides are relocatable objects and are directly comparable.
A unit may hold several functions, so the target range is sliced out using the
function's address and size from the index.

    Words carrying a relocation resolve the way the linker will (S + A from

    It was rejected at 39 of 40 bytes despite producing an identical ROM.

    Deliberately strict: same offsets, same types, ABS32 only, both symbols
    known, and every differing byte must fall inside a relocation site.

    ONE ASYMMETRY, added in wave 60 -- the candidate may carry an ABS32 at an
    offset where the TARGET HAS NO RELOCATION AT ALL. That is an ABSOLUTE
    SYMBOL: `asm/` is disassembled ROM, so a pool word holding a link-time

    relocate, while the C that produced it names the symbol and emits `.word 0`
    plus `R_ARM_ABS32 gNumMusicPlayers`. Pairing by POSITION made those
    functions unreachable twice over: the length gate rejected them outright,
    and even past it the offsets slipped by one. Four m4a functions sat at one
    differing byte for thirteen waves on this.

    It is accepted only when the symbol is in the real symbol table -- the
    linker script or the last ELF -- and the value the linker will store
    (S + A, T bit for a THUMB function) equals the ROM word exactly. THE

    converting a visible near-miss into a build break blaming another file.
    Requiring a real definition is what welds this to aw2bhr.lds: the only way
    to make the check pass is to make the link work.

    The reverse shape stays rejected. A relocation on the TARGET side that the

    ONE translation unit, and compare the unit's entire .text with the ROM.

    THIS EXISTS BECAUSE THE PER-FUNCTION ORACLE HAS A BLIND SPOT IT CANNOT CLOSE
    BY CONSTRUCTION. `check()` compiles one function per object, so every call
    it makes is external and carries a relocation. The original source compiled
    the whole unit at once, so a call to a `static` helper defined beside it was
    resolved by the assembler and carries NO relocation at all. Wave 27 hit this
    on AgbMain: it calls a two-byte `for (;;) ;` at 0x08036B48 with a
    locally-resolved `bl`, 2 of 252 bytes differ, and NO draft can fix it --
    for `check()` to see no relocation the helper must be defined in AgbMain's
    own object, while the merged unit may define it exactly once. Seven
    already-matching siblings were stuck behind that, because a unit promotes
    whole or not at all.

    A unit that reproduces its whole .text is STRICTLY STRONGER evidence than
    every function in it matching separately -- it is precisely what the split
    build links. So `promote.py` may accept it. That is not relaxing the gate,
    which is the one thing wave 18 said never to do; it is pointing the gate at
    the thing that makes it true.

    Every function in the unit must have a draft -- EXCEPT an asm-resident one,
    which by definition never will (see below). A unit is all-or-nothing, so any
    other missing draft is a hard failure, not a skip.

    ASM-RESIDENT MEMBERS ARE TREATED AS ALREADY SATISFIED (wave 28). A unit
    holding a function listed in data/asm-resident.json used to be untestable by
    BOTH oracles: `check()` cannot see a locally-resolved call, and `check_unit()`
    demanded a draft that, for an asm-resident function, is never going to exist.
    sub_0802C604 sat behind exactly that -- its unit also holds sub_0802C62A, the
    two-byte `movs r0, r0` that upstream labelled as a function.

    Skipping them CANNOT produce a false pass, which is why this is safe. The
    comparison below is unchanged: the merged C still has to reproduce the unit's
    ENTIRE .text, asm-resident bytes included. So a pass is positive proof that
    the compiler emits those bytes itself (they were alignment padding all along,
    mislabelled by an upstream `thumb_func_start`), and a real hand-written
    assembly member simply makes the unit fail. This converts an exit-2 "cannot
    test" into an honest verdict; it does not lower the bar.
