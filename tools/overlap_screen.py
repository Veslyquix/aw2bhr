"""Rank unmatched functions by their proximity to an ALREADY-MATCHED one.

Every band screen this project has run filtered on `size >= 256 &&
backward_branches == 0`. Wave 20 (W20-C) found that floor was wrong: the 0x08052
sprite block holds five matched exemplars interleaved with seven unmatched
siblings at 144-256 bytes, and no band screen ever showed it. Size was never the
right floor -- EXEMPLAR PROXIMITY is, and it is cheap to measure.

Two measurements, both off `calls` in data/functions.json, plus one off the
assembly itself:

  overlap    |shared callees| and the Jaccard ratio between an unmatched
             function and every matched one. `calls` is invariant to inserted
             code, which is why wave 19 could batch on it where a normalised
             shape string scored the same pair 0.366.

  duplicate  the normalised instruction stream, label names erased. Two
             functions with the same stream have the SAME C body -- match one
             and the other is transcription. This is the highest-value thing
             the screen finds and it costs one pass over asm/.

  cluster    unmatched functions that share a matched exemplar, plus every
             unmatched function that is itself close to one of them. That is
             the unit a wave can be batched on.

  delta      WAVE 59. The residual's KIND, measured off the DRAFT rather than
             off the address map. Every axis above is address- or callee-based
             and they are all spent -- the clean pool ended in wave 57, so what
             is left is 300 functions that each already carry a draft, and what
             separates them is what their draft's residual IS. See delta_rows().

requires sub_08052650/sub_08052AF4 to come back as a byte-identical pair and
sub_08052718/sub_08052BBC to come back grouped with the matched sub_08051BEC
and sub_08051F4C. A screen that cannot rediscover a cluster we know is real is
not finding the ones we do not.

    This is the axis the callee-set screen is blind to, and it is the axis the
    wave-20 W20-C batch actually lived on. sub_08052358 has ONE callee, so
    `|shared callees| >= 4` can never see it -- but its four data_refs are a
    strict subset of the matched sub_08052154's, every type it needed was
    already declared, and it matched on the first attempt. A subset means the
    exemplar's type model covers the target completely: no new struct, no new
    global, no new prototype.

    TWO DEFECTS FIXED IN WAVE 20 (found by W20-A, fixed here):

    1. `matched` used to be filtered `status == "matched" and r["calls"]`. That
       guard belongs to the CALLEE axis -- this function never looks at `calls`
       -- and it silently excluded every matched LEAF, 596 of them, from ever
       being a data_refs exemplar. It is why sub_08075368 was reported as "57%
       of sub_08076494" when its four refs are in fact EQUAL to those of three
       different matched functions the screen could not see.
    2. The reported degree, `len(target_refs) / len(exemplar_refs)`, was
       PRESENTED as a percentage "of" the exemplar and read as coverage. That
       reading carries no information: coverage is 100% by construction, since
       this axis only reports subsets. The number is gone.

       IT WAS NOT, HOWEVER, ANTI-CORRELATED, and the proposal to rank by the
       exemplar's SIZE instead is inverted. That degree is maximised by the
       exemplar whose vocabulary is CLOSEST to the target's, which is the right
       one to read: an exemplar using the target's four globals and nothing
       else is about the same thing. Measured against the two functions this
       axis actually produced in wave 20:

           sub_08052358   5 covering exemplars, sub_08052154 was the one read
                          tightest-first rank 1,  widest-first rank 5
           sub_08050134  11 covering exemplars, sub_08052154 was the one read
                          tightest-first rank 1,  widest-first rank 11

       Widest-first puts the exemplar an agent actually used LAST in both
       cases, because the widest cover of any small ref set is whatever large
       function happens to touch those globals among dozens -- sub_0801258C
       covers sub_08075368's four refs among its own 88, and covers 24 other
       targets the same way. Selection therefore stays tightest-first; what
       changed is that the ratio is no longer printed as though it measured
       coverage.

       Printed instead: the number of refs covered, the TIGHTEST exemplar with
       its own ref count so the fit is visible, and HOW MANY distinct matched
       functions cover the target -- the last of these new, exposed by the leaf
       fix, and the one that separates a lucky pairing from a vocabulary that
       is thoroughly worked out.

    THE TIE-BREAK WAS WRONG, AND WAVE 21 (W21-C) MEASURED IT. Ref-count
    minimality is the right PRIMARY key -- it is the subset guarantee -- but it
    ties constantly, and the tie was broken by `m["size"]` ASCENDING, i.e. by
    preferring the smallest covering exemplar. Smallest means "does least",
    which means "demonstrates fewest of the operations the target performs".

    The controlled case: sub_08012358 (36 B) and sub_08085F40 (80 B) have
    IDENTICAL data_refs -- {gUnknown_03001FFC, gUnknown_03002020,
    gUnknown_03002B28, gUnknown_030030E0} -- and both are zero-call leaves, so
    they tie on every key the screen had except size, and the smallest-first
    tie-break named sub_08012358 for twelve targets. sub_08012358's entire body
    is four zero stores. Against the four 96-116 B targets W21-C took on that
    exact ref set it supplied NOTHING beyond "these globals are declared", and
    it is worse than uninformative: it writes `gUnknown_030030E0.raw = 0`, and
    the union `.raw` spelling is precisely the one that FAILS on any target
    performing a read-modify-write (it drags a live zero into a spurious `orr`
    and costs a register -- see c_08085F40.c). sub_08085F40, the exemplar the
    old tie-break ranked second, is the one that carried the whole batch.

    So the tie-break is now PROXIMITY: closest in size, then closest in callee
    count. On those four targets |dsize| to sub_08085F40 is 16-36 and to
    sub_08012358 is 60-80, so proximity picks the useful one every time. This
    does NOT reinstate the widest-first proposal rejected above: the primary key
    is still minimal ref count, and "nearest" is bounded on both sides where
    "widest" was not.

    `nearest` is also reported separately -- the best covering exemplar by
    proximity ALONE, ignoring ref count -- and printed only when it differs from
    `tightest`. Reporting both is cheap and loses nothing; where they disagree,
    that disagreement is itself the signal that the tightest cover is a
    vocabulary match rather than a shape match.

    THE POINT OF SPLITTING THESE THREE IS THAT trymatch REPORTS ONLY THEIR SUM,
    and the sum is a different quantity from any of them. `sub_08045FC8` reports
    `size: match` at 104 bytes with a candidate whose CODE is 2 bytes shorter:
    the literal pool must start on a 4-byte boundary, so the shortfall comes
    straight back as alignment padding and the totals agree. It is a
    one-extra-instruction residual wearing a size-exact costume, and every
    screen keyed on the reported size will keep re-selecting it forever.

    There is a second way the same lie is told, and it is invisible from the
    other side: `_cand.bin` is objcopy's dump of the whole `.text` SECTION,
    which the assembler rounds up to its 4-byte alignment. So a candidate whose
    code is 2 bytes short of a 2-mod-4 ROM function also reports `size: match`,

    already reads to spot an unpromoted match -- so a full-corpus delta screen
    costs one pass over work/ and one over asm/, not 300 invocations of agbcc.

    THE SCORE IS RECOMPUTED FROM THE BINS, NOT READ FROM best.json. best.json
    tracks `best.c`, which is a DIFFERENT FILE from the draft on disk, and the
    gap between them has misled two waves: wave 56 had best.json reading 33.99%
    at the moment trymatch returned exit 0 on the draft beside it, and wave 57
    had 56.9% quoted for a draft that was 18.5%. The arithmetic below is
    trymatch's own, on trymatch's own output bytes, so it describes the draft.

    THREE INTEGRITY GATES, each reported by name rather than silently dropped.
    A screen whose inputs can go stale without saying so is how this project
    loses screens.

      stale draft      <fn>.c is NEWER than _cand.bin -- somebody edited the
                       draft after the last trymatch run, so the measurement
                       describes code that no longer exists.
      stale .s         <fn>.s is NEWER than _cand.bin. compile_probe and
                       permute.py both write into work/<fn>/, so the assembly
                       listing is not always the compile the .bin came from.
                       sub_0803BF10 has a .s from eight days after its .bin and
                       the two disagree by 24 bytes.
      unaccounted      the parsed layout does not add up to the bytes that
                       actually exist (rounded up to .text's 4-byte alignment on
                       the candidate side, exact on the ROM side). This is the
                       check that makes the code/pool split evidence rather than
                       a plausible-looking number -- if a line cannot be
                       classified, the totals disagree and the row is dropped
                       instead of reported with a wrong split.

      small       A residual of one or two THUMB instructions inside a loop is
                  the induction-variable signature. sub_080200EC was open for
                  seventeen waves and fell on the first attempt once it was
                  read as "the candidate is missing a second source variable";
                  sub_0800CAA0 is the same axis pointing the other way, the
                  candidate carrying a giv the ROM does not. Both are the same
                  small delta. This is the group with a known lever.
      size-exact  Being the right length rules out missing statements and wrong
                  loop structure, but what is left -- allocation, constant
                  placement, cross-jump block selection -- includes two kinds
                  no spelling reaches. It still converted 3 of 11 in wave 58,
                  above the 13.6% drafted baseline, so it is not a bad class;
                  it is a worse class than small.
      large       Probably a shape, and wave 57 measured 11 of 11 drafted
                  residuals as NOT shapes. A large delta here more often means
                  the draft is old than that the shape is wrong.

    WITHIN EVERY KIND, work nobody has spent a slot on sorts first. That is this
    file's existing convention -- report() already builds `targets` from `asm`
    only, because a parked function has had a slot spent on it and was
    deliberately not handed out again -- and the delta screen must not quietly
    reverse it. Such rows are still LISTED, because parked.json's ruled-out axes
    are the most valuable part of a draft and a delta the parker never measured
    is new information; they are just not offered ahead of untouched work.

    "SPENT" IS NOT THE SAME AS "PARKED", and this screen's own first outing
    proved it. sub_08045FC8 came out near the top of the small group and is
    among the most exhausted functions in the tree: three decomp-permuter runs,
    ten measured source shapes, four ruled-out axes, two waves of park notes --
    all of it recorded in the draft, none of it in `status`, which is `asm`. A
    `work/<fn>/permuter/` directory is the durable evidence, so it demotes too;
    43 `asm`-status drafts carry one.

    WITHIN small: loop-carrying first, then |code delta| ascending. NOT by
    score, and that is deliberate rather than an oversight -- this project's
    score is POSITIONAL, so it records where the divergence starts and not how
    much is left, and ranking on it would contradict the rule the rest of this
    file is built on.

      The loops term is the measured one. Wave 58's probe was on loop-carrying
      drafts specifically, and both functions it names -- sub_080200EC, missing
      a second source induction variable, and sub_0800CAA0, carrying a pointer
      giv the ROM does not -- are loop functions whose residual IS the induction
      variable. A small delta with no loop is a different mechanism.

      The |code delta| term is REASONED, NOT MEASURED, and is flagged as such
      so nobody cites it back as a finding: a residual of one THUMB instruction
      is fewer decisions than one of four, and wave 58's data (16 of 23 at
      +/-4) says only that the group is tight, not that +/-2 beats +/-4.

    WITHIN size-exact: score ASCENDING, and 93%+ drafts that have ALREADY BEEN
    PARKED ONCE sink to the bottom of the group. Wave 58 measured six size-exact
    loop functions: both matches came from the lowest-scoring drafts (87.9% and
    66.9%) and all three at 93%+ were instruction-ORDER decisions of which not
    one moved. An order-only difference leaves prologue, body and tail intact so
    it reads HIGH; a wrong register or operand order early reads low and is
    often one edit. The 93%+ drafts are not filtered out -- they are listed with
    a `parked-high` tag, because "screened out" and "ranked last" differ exactly
    when the diff shows something other than order, which is the documented
    exception.

    that wave -- families 0 with_exemplar, callee overlap 0 pairs, duplicates 0
    usable groups, data_refs subset down to 3 -- and the work was still there.

    The insight is that a block's cost is its VOCABULARY, not its shapes. Ten
    small functions from one already-half-promoted block reuse the same globals,
    the same struct layouts and the same callee prototypes; the promoted
    siblings have already written all of that down. The shapes are unrelated and
    that does not matter. Wave 24's W24-C matched its assigned 13 in two
    compile_probe rounds and 13 first-attempt try_match calls.

    Two limits, both measured, both worth stating in the brief:
      - It is only cheap where the block is ALREADY half promoted. A cold block
        has no vocabulary to inherit and behaves nothing like this.
      - These are small functions. Wave 24's 109 are ~4,500 bytes; wave 23's 17
        were 3,344. Function count and byte count diverged long ago.

    AND DO NOT BATCH ON A (size, calls, refs) SIGNATURE. It looks like it finds
    25-member families. Wave 24 checked three members of one and got a rounding
    divide, a byte-store wrapper and a stack-args forwarder -- the same
    false-positive mode wave 21 recorded for duplicate signatures. Group by
    LOCALITY and tell the agent the shapes are unrelated.

    Three criteria, set by the wave brief before the screen was written, plus
    two structural ones. The point of writing them down before the tool is that
    a screen which produces plausible-looking output it cannot validate is worse
    than no screen -- that sentence is why families.py has a self-test and why
    the ad-hoc wave-58 probe this replaces was worth nothing once its scratchpad
    was deleted.

    ANCHORS RETIRE GRACEFULLY. Criteria 2 and 3 name three specific functions,
    and the moment one is matched and promoted it leaves the drafted pool and
    the check can never pass again. Wave 20 wrote two anchors that wave 21
    parked, and from wave 21 to wave 33 this file's self-test carried two
    permanently-red checks -- which hides the regression the test exists to
    catch. So an anchor that is no longer unmatched PASSES with a loud note
    saying it has retired, and only a REPORTED-BUT-WRONG anchor fails.

    TWO WAYS TO STOP BEING UNMATCHED, AND THE SECOND ONE BIT WITHIN AN HOUR OF
    THIS TEST BEING WRITTEN. "Gone from the pool" only catches PROMOTION, which
    happens at wave end. sub_08059F24 and sub_0805A008 were matched by
    try_match later in the same wave that wrote this check, so they were still
    `status: asm` in data/functions.json -- still measured, still listed, now
    reporting +0 and 100.0% -- and criterion 2 went red for the best possible
    reason. A row whose candidate reproduces the ROM bytes is a MATCH pending
    promotion (this is what apply_pending() reads the same files for), and it
    retires the anchor exactly as promotion would.
