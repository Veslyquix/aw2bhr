"""Brute-force a near-match with decomp-permuter, then judge it with trymatch.

This exists for one failure mode. A candidate can be semantically correct,
compile to the right instructions in the right order, and still not match
because a value landed in the wrong register -- and register allocation is
decided by phrasing the source rather than by what it computes, so it is
reachable by rewriting and not by reasoning. `docs/agbcc-codegen.md` records two
functions where fourteen and eight rewrites respectively all produced identical
output. The permuter searches that space mechanically.

Two things are worth being precise about.

**The permuter's score is not the verdict.** It scores by diffing objdump text,
so it ignores encoding details and stops at the boundary of what objdump prints.
Every candidate it produces is re-checked here with tools/trymatch.py, which
compares the encoded bytes and the relocations. A permuter score of 0 that
trymatch rejects is a real outcome, not a bug.

Measured, the two are not even monotonically related: on both blocked functions
the permuter's best-scoring candidate was a byte-level *regression* -- 35 -> 30
while bytes went 80% -> 75%, and 220 -> 80 while bytes went 88.2% -> 55.9%.
That is why the original source is restored when nothing matches, and why
best.c is only ever moved forward by trymatch's own measurement.

**target.o must contain the target function and nothing else.** The scorer
disassembles the whole object, so a multi-function unit would make every score
meaningless while still looking like it worked. This refuses to run in that case
rather than produce numbers that cannot be trusted.

    python tools/permute.py sub_08063980 --seconds 600
    python tools/permute.py sub_08001158 --setup-only   # inspect, do not run

The vendored permuter is not committed; see vendor/README.md.

**Output (wave 90).** The search's progress is no longer echoed: the
permuter's carriage-return counter is ~400 KB a minute and several agents
redirect it into their own logs. It goes to work/<fn>/permuter/permuter.log,
compacted (every message kept; the iteration counter as one snapshot a minute
plus the final one). Each candidate's full trymatch report goes to
permuter/verify.log; the console gets one line per candidate. `--live` restores
the old raw echo. The run ends with one line to read:

    PERMUTE MATCH sub_X
    PERMUTE IMPROVED sub_X 93.68 -> 95.11 (kept in work/sub_X/sub_X.c)
    PERMUTE NO-IMPROVEMENT sub_X
    PERMUTE SETUP-FAILED sub_X

**Threads default to 4**, not every core: agents share this machine and each
runs up to three searches.

**Only a readable candidate is kept in the draft.** An improvement is written
to <fn>.c only in its spliced form (the draft's own includes plus the new
function). If only the header-expanded raw form improves, it goes to
permuter/best-raw.c and best.c/best.json are put back as they were -- that path
is how 36 best.c files became 190 KB blobs (preflight's BLOB list).
