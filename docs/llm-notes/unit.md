## Note 1 — original line 5

/* Unit/CO code, contiguous from 0x08042B70 through 0x08043630.
 * The preceding gap is undecompiled; the following function uses inline assembly.
 * Preserve function order for the original ROM layout. */

## Note 2 — original line 22

````c
/* gUnknown_030044B0 is declared `u8 []`, so the word store at +8 needs a cast.
 * The BASE must be bound to a local first: writing
 * `*(u32 *)(gUnknown_030044B0 + 8)` folds the 8 into the pool word as
 * `gUnknown_030044B0+0x8` and stores at `[r2]`, where the ROM has a clean
 * `gUnknown_030044B0` pool word and `str r0, [r2, #8]`. Same instruction
 * count -- the difference is entirely in the relocation addend.
 *
 * The element address is recomputed for the second store because the first
 * `strb` kills gPlayers's MEM (it is a non-const pointer global). */

/*
 * GetCoPriceMultiplier, GetUnitMovementWithCoBonus, GetUnitFiringRangeWithCoBonus and GetUnitVisionWithCoBonus are named per
 * Xenesis's AW2 Subroutine List: "Gathers Price multipliers of CO",
 * "Collects Mov Range + CO Boosts", "Collects Max Firing Range + CO Boosts"
 * and "Gathers Vision Total of CO" respectively. GetUnitAttackWithCoBonus/GetUnitDefenceWithCoBonus
 * aren't separately cited there, but they're structurally identical to the
 * cited Mov/Range/Vision trio one function over (base stat + CO bonus, same
 * `+ 0x64` bias), so they're named by that analogy: attack and defence are
 * the two stats the cited trio's family (GetCoAttackBonus.../GetCoRangeBonus
 * in src/unit.c) doesn't already cover. The old sub_XXXXXXXX
 * symbols are kept as linker aliases below so every other unit keeps
 * resolving them unchanged.

## Note 4 — original line 68

````c
/* The parent argument doubles as a tree NUMBER and a real ProcPtr, and the
 * signed `cmp #7` is what tells them apart -- hence the `(int)` cast, which a
 * pointer comparison would not give.
 *
 * The arms are written `<= 7` with Proc_Start first, so the ROM's `bgt` reaches
 * the else. That is the ORDINARY sense: these two arms REJOIN, and for
 * rejoining arms agbcc branches on the NEGATED condition to the else and leaves
 * the then inline. It is the opposite of what the same source shape does when
 * both arms `return` (see sub_08017CF0), where the else goes inline instead.
 *
 * unk64/unk66 are reached by advancing the base (`adds r0,#0x64` then
 * `adds r0,#2`) because 0x64 is past `strh`'s 5-bit displacement; unk2c/unk30
 * stay in the displacement, which is why only the halfword pair walks. */

/* The two bounds are bound to LOCALS, and that is what the ROM's compares need.
 * Written as literals, agbcc's tree-level `fold` canonicalises `>= 2` to `> 1`
 * and, knowing unk18 is a u8, picks unsigned branches -- `cmp #3; bhi` /
 * `cmp #1; bls`. Via int locals the comparison is typed `int` at tree level, so
 * neither the fold nor the range-narrowing fires, and constant propagation
 * still puts both values back in the `cmp` immediates. Exactly the lever
 * docs/agbcc-codegen.md records for sub_08044BA0 (wave 26, W26-B).

/* Family F049: four copies of one body that differ ONLY in the s16 index K
 * (0, 1, 2, 3 -- `movs rN, #0/2/4/6` at the three `ldrsh` sites), exactly as
 * data/families.json `varies` says.
 *
 * Three things had to be read off the ROM rather than guessed:
 *
 * 1. struct Unk085D3DD0Entry.unk24 is an array of POINTERS. The ROM does
 *    `ldr r7,[r3]` on the table word and then `ldrsh r0,[r7,r2]` through the
 *    result. 0x24 + 8*4 == 0x44 fills the record exactly, and the two indices
 *    in use (gUnknown_085D5ABC[c].unk18, and GetUnitCombatClassColumn's 5/6/7) span it.
 *
 * 2. Both lookups happen BEFORE the gPlaySt.coAbilities early-out. That is
 *    not scheduling -- agbcc will not hoist a load above a branch -- so the
 *    two assignments really are the first two statements, unlike the F038
 *    accessors in c_08042E2C.c where the early-out comes first.
 *
 * 3. gUnknown_085D5ABC is NOT const, and that is what the second
 *    `ldrb r0,[r6,#0x18]` proves. With the header's old `const` the load is
 *    CSEd across `bl GetUnitCombatClassColumn`, the value rather than the address lives in
 *    r6, and the function is two bytes short. See the note on the declaration
 *    in include/unknown-globals.h.
 *
 * The dead `ldr r7, =gUnknown_085D3DD0` at the top and the folded pool word
 * `gUnknown_085D3DD0 + 0x5c` (which asm/ symbolises as gUnknown_085D3E2C) both
 * fall straight out of the plain member spelling under -fforce-addr; neither
 * is something to reproduce by hand. */

 *
 * `movs r1, #0; ldrsh r0, [r0, r1]` is not a variation on the matched siblings
 * -- every member of F038 uses it, including GetCoLuckBonus/E84/FC4 -- it is just
 * how an s16 member is reached once the offset has been folded onto the base.
 * No re-narrowing after the load, so the return is `int`.

 * THREE parameters, not the two this was first promoted with. The third is
 * unused in this member's body, so the body cannot tell you -- the evidence is
